# Claude Wrapper Script Refactoring Notes

## Date: 2025-07-18

### File: `claude-wrapper.sh`

### Changes Made:

1. **Added comprehensive header documentation**
   - Purpose, usage, environment variables, dependencies, and security notes
   - Follows production documentation standards

2. **Added error handling flags**
   - `set -euo pipefail` for robust error handling
   - Consistent with `entrypoint.sh` in the same directory

3. **Added dependency validation**
   - Checks for `jq` availability before use
   - Provides clear error message if missing

4. **Improved error handling**
   - Validates JSON parsing with proper error redirection
   - Handles missing credentials file gracefully (not an error)
   - Warns when credentials file exists but no key found

5. **Enhanced security considerations**
   - Added security notes in header
   - No sensitive data is logged
   - Uses `exec` to replace process cleanly

6. **Improved code readability**
   - Clear variable names
   - Structured flow with comments
   - Separated concerns into logical blocks

### Rationale:

The original script was functional but lacked production-ready features:

- No error handling for malformed JSON or missing dependencies
- No documentation for maintainers
- Inconsistent with other scripts in the project
- Silent failures could occur

The refactored version brings the script up to production standards while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Testing:

- Syntax validated with `bash -n`
- Logic preserves original behavior
- Compatible with Docker build process

### File: `monitor-wrapper.sh`

### Changes Made:

1. **Added comprehensive header documentation**
   - Purpose, usage, environment variables, dependencies, and security notes
   - Matches the documentation style of `claude-wrapper.sh`

2. **Added error handling flags**
   - `set -euo pipefail` for robust error handling
   - Ensures script fails fast on errors

3. **Added dependency validation**
   - Checks for `python3` availability before use
   - Provides clear error message if missing

4. **Added path validation**
   - Validates monitor directory exists
   - Validates Python script exists
   - Provides helpful error messages for troubleshooting

5. **Added configuration variables**
   - `MONITOR_APP_DIR` - Configurable monitor directory
   - `MONITOR_SCRIPT` - Configurable script name
   - Allows flexibility for different environments

6. **Improved error handling**
   - Validates directory change operation
   - Clear error messages with context
   - Uses stderr for error output

7. **Enhanced security**
   - No argument manipulation or injection risks
   - Clear documentation about argument passthrough
   - Validated paths before execution

### Rationale:

The original script was minimal and lacked production-ready features:

- No error handling for missing Python or files
- No documentation for maintainers
- Hardcoded paths without validation
- Silent failures could occur
- Inconsistent with the better-structured `claude-wrapper.sh`

The refactored version brings the script up to the same production standards as `claude-wrapper.sh` while maintaining full backward compatibility.

### Testing:

- Syntax validated with `bash -n`
- Logic preserves original behavior
- All paths and dependencies are validated before execution
- Compatible with Docker build process and entrypoint routing
