# Claude Wrapper Script Refactoring Notes

## Date: 2025-07-18

### File: `claude-wrapper.sh`

### Changes Made:

1. **Added comprehensive header documentation**
   - Purpose, usage, environment variables, dependencies, and security notes
   - Follows production documentation standards

2. **Added error handling flags**
   - `set -euo pipefail` for robust error handling
   - Consistent with `entrypoint.sh` in the same directory

3. **Added dependency validation**
   - Checks for `jq` availability before use
   - Provides clear error message if missing

4. **Improved error handling**
   - Validates JSON parsing with proper error redirection
   - Handles missing credentials file gracefully (not an error)
   - Warns when credentials file exists but no key found

5. **Enhanced security considerations**
   - Added security notes in header
   - No sensitive data is logged
   - Uses `exec` to replace process cleanly

6. **Improved code readability**
   - Clear variable names
   - Structured flow with comments
   - Separated concerns into logical blocks

### Rationale:

The original script was functional but lacked production-ready features:

- No error handling for malformed JSON or missing dependencies
- No documentation for maintainers
- Inconsistent with other scripts in the project
- Silent failures could occur

The refactored version brings the script up to production standards while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Testing:

- Syntax validated with `bash -n`
- Logic preserves original behavior
- Compatible with Docker build process
