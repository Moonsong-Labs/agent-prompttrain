# Docker Images Split - Summary

Following Gemini's microservices recommendation, the Docker setup has been successfully split into two separate images.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Separate Dockerfiles
- `docker/proxy/Dockerfile` - Proxy service image (178MB)
- `docker/dashboard/Dockerfile` - Dashboard service image (157MB)
- Both use multi-stage builds with Bun runtime

### 2. Updated docker-compose.yml
- Removed unified SERVICE environment variable
- Now uses separate images for each service
- Services can be scaled independently

### 3. Created Build Script
- `docker/build-images.sh` - Builds both images
- Shows image sizes after build

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md to reflect separate images
- Updated CLAUDE.md for AI guidance
- Created docker/README.md with detailed information

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Better Separation of Concerns**
   - Each service has only its dependencies
   - Reduced attack surface

2. **Independent Scaling**
   - Scale proxy without scaling dashboard
   - Better resource utilization

3. **Smaller Images**
   - Proxy: 178MB (down from unified image)
   - Dashboard: 157MB (down from unified image)

4. **Easier Maintenance**
   - Update services independently
   - Faster builds for individual services

## Usage

```bash
# Build both images
./docker/build-images.sh

# Run with docker-compose
docker-compose up

# Or run individually
docker run -p 3000:3000 alanpurestake/claude-nexus-proxy:latest
docker run -p 3001:3001 alanpurestake/claude-nexus-dashboard:latest
```

This completes the task of following Gemini's advice to split the Docker images.
