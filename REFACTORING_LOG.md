# Refactoring Log

## 2025-01-20: GitHubSyncService.ts Production Readiness

### Changes Made:

1. **Extracted Constants**
   - Added `SYNC_INFO_FILENAME`, `ALLOWED_PROMPT_EXTENSIONS`, and `SERVICE_NAME` constants
   - Replaced hardcoded values throughout the code

2. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Created `logError()` helper method to standardize error logging
   - Replaced 7 instances of repetitive error logging pattern
   - Consistent error metadata with service name

3. **Enhanced Type Safety**
   - Added `PromptFile` interface for better type checking
   - Improved method signatures with proper types

4. **Extracted Validation Logic**
   - Created `isValidPromptFile()` method for file extension validation
   - Created `hasPathTraversalChars()` method for security validation
   - Eliminated duplicate validation code

5. **Maintained Backward Compatibility**
   - Kept the same public API
   - No breaking changes to method signatures
   - Preserved error throwing behavior for SyncScheduler compatibility

### Benefits:

- Reduced code duplication
- Improved maintainability
- More consistent error handling
- Better security with centralized validation
- Easier to extend supported file types in the future

### Next Steps (Future Sprints):

- Add unit tests for the service
- Consider dependency injection for better testability
- Implement atomic sync operations for reliability
- Update SyncScheduler to handle structured return values
