# Follow-up Issue: Investigate Root Cause of Storage Failures

## Background

We've implemented a grandparent fallback mechanism in the ConversationLinker to handle cases where parent requests are missing due to storage failures. While this provides immediate relief, we need to investigate and fix the root cause.

## Issue Description

Requests are sometimes failing to be stored properly in the database, causing subsequent requests to lose their conversation context. This forces us to implement workarounds like the grandparent fallback.

## Investigation Steps

1. **Analyze Storage Logs**

   - Look for patterns in storage failures
   - Check for database connection issues
   - Monitor for transaction rollbacks

2. **Check for Race Conditions**

   - Concurrent write attempts
   - Async storage operations that might fail silently

3. **Review Error Handling**

   - Ensure all storage errors are properly logged
   - Check if errors are being swallowed somewhere

4. **Monitor Grandparent Fallback Usage**
   - Track how often the fallback is triggered
   - Look for patterns in when it's needed

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Root cause of storage failures identified
- [ ] Fix implemented to prevent request storage failures
- [ ] Monitoring in place to detect future failures
- [ ] Consider if grandparent fallback can be removed after fix

## Priority

**HIGH** - This is a data integrity issue that affects conversation continuity
