# Retry Module Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Refactored `services/proxy/src/utils/retry.ts` to improve type safety, code clarity, and separation of concerns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved Type Safety

- Created `HttpError` interface with proper types for statusCode and response properties
- Added `isHttpError` type guard to safely check error types
- Eliminated all uses of `any` type
- Changed error parameter types from `Error` to `unknown` for better safety

### 2. Better Error Handling Architecture

- Broke down monolithic `isRetryableError` into composable functions:
  - `isNetworkError()` - checks for network-related errors
  - `isRetryableHttpError()` - checks HTTP status codes
  - `isRetryableError()` - main function using composition
- Moved error constants to top of file for clarity

### 3. Integrated Retry-After Support

- Moved `getRetryAfter` logic directly into `retryWithBackoff`
- Now respects server's `Retry-After` header automatically
- Ensures minimum delay is maintained even with retry-after

### 4. Removed Unused Code

- Deleted `createRateLimitAwareRetry` function (not used anywhere)
- Removed duplicate `getRetryAfter` function at end of file

### 5. Separated Concerns

- Made retry module generic, removed Claude-specific error handling
- Added documentation on how to compose application-specific retry conditions
- Moved Claude-specific retry logic to `ClaudeApiClient` where it belongs

### 6. Updated ClaudeApiClient

- Created `isClaudeRetryableError` function for Claude-specific errors
- Updated retry call to use composed retry condition
- Maintains all existing functionality while improving modularity

## Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: No more runtime errors from incorrect type assumptions
2. **Modularity**: Easy to add new retry conditions without modifying core logic
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between generic and application-specific logic
4. **Best Practices**: Respects HTTP standards (Retry-After header)
5. **Code Quality**: Cleaner, more readable, and easier to test

## Testing Notes

- No existing tests for retry module
- Type checking passes for modified files
- Functionality preserved - ClaudeApiClient still uses same retry behavior
- Added proper error type handling throughout
