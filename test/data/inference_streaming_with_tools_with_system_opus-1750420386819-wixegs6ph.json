Be sure to adhere to these instructions. IMPORTANT: These instructions OVERRIDE any default behavior and you MUST follow them exactly as written.\n\nContents of /home/crystalin/projects/claude-nexus-proxy/CLAUDE.md (project instructions, checked into the codebase):\n\n# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with this repository.\n\n## Project Overview\n\nAgent PromptTrain - A high-performance proxy for Claude API with monitoring dashboard. Built with Bun and Hono framework, deployed as separate Docker images for each service.\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Monorepo Structure\n\n```\nclaude-nexus-proxy/\n├── packages/shared/      # Shared types and configurations\n├── services/\n│   ├── proxy/           # Proxy API service (Port 3000)\n│   └── dashboard/       # Dashboard web service (Port 3001)\n├── scripts/             # Utility scripts\n├── docker/              # Docker configurations\n│   ├── proxy/           # Proxy Dockerfile\n│   └── dashboard/       # Dashboard Dockerfile\n└── docker-compose.yml   # Container orchestration\n```\n\n### Key Services\n\n**Proxy Service** (`services/proxy/`)\n\n- Direct API forwarding to Claude\n- Multi-auth support (API keys, OAuth with auto-refresh)\n- Token tracking and telemetry\n- Request/response storage\n- Slack notifications\n\n**Dashboard Service** (`services/dashboard/`)\n\n- Real-time monitoring UI\n- Analytics and usage charts\n- Request history browser\n- SSE for live updates\n\n## Development\n\n```bash\n# Install dependencies\nbun install\n\n# Run both services\nbun run dev\n\n# Run individually\nbun run dev:proxy      # Port 3000\nbun run dev:dashboard  # Port 3001\n\n# Build\nbun run build\n```\n\n## Docker Deployment\n\nThe project uses **separate Docker images** for each service:\n\n```bash\n# Build images\n./docker/build-images.sh\n\n# Run proxy service\ndocker run -p 3000:3000 alanpurestake/claude-nexus-proxy:latest\n\n# Run dashboard service\ndocker run -p 3001:3001 alanpurestake/claude-nexus-dashboard:latest\n```\n\nDocker configurations are in the `docker/` directory. Each service has its own optimized image for better security, scaling, and maintainability.\n\n## Key Implementation Details\n\n### Authentication Flow\n\n**Client Authentication (Proxy Level):**\n\n1. Extract domain from Host header\n2. Check for `client_api_key` in domain credential file\n3. Verify Bearer token against stored key using timing-safe comparison\n4. Return 401 Unauthorized if invalid\n\n**Claude API Authentication:**\n\n1. Check domain-specific credential files (`<domain>.credentials.json`)\n2. Use Authorization header from request\n3. Fall back to CLAUDE_API_KEY environment variable\n\n### OAuth Support\n\n- Auto-refresh tokens 1 minute before expiry\n- Stores refreshed tokens back to credential files\n- Adds `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20` header\n\n### Token Tracking\n\n- Per-domain statistics\n- Request type classification (query evaluation vs inference)\n- Tool call counting\n- Available at `/token-stats` endpoint\n\n### Storage\n\n- PostgreSQL for request/response data\n- Write-only access from proxy\n- Read-only access from dashboard\n- Automatic batch processing\n\n### Debug Logging\n\nWhen `DEBUG=true`:\n\n- Logs full request/response (with sensitive data masked)\n- Shows streaming chunks\n- Masks patterns: `sk-ant-****`, `Bearer ****`\n\n## Environment Variables\n\n**Essential:**\n\n- `CLAUDE_API_KEY` - Default API key (optional)\n- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection\n- `DASHBOARD_API_KEY` - Dashboard authentication\n\n**Optional:**\n\n- `DEBUG` - Enable debug logging\n- `STORAGE_ENABLED` - Enable storage (default: false)\n- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - Slack notifications\n- `CREDENTIALS_DIR` - Domain credential directory\n- `COLLECT_TEST_SAMPLES` - Collect request samples for testing (default: false)\n- `TEST_SAMPLES_DIR` - Directory for test samples (default: test-samples)\n- `ENABLE_CLIENT_AUTH` - Enable client API key authentication (default: true). Set to false to allow anyone to use the proxy without authentication\n\n## Testing & Type Safety\n\n**Type Checking:**\n\n- Run `bun run typecheck` before committing\n- Type checking is automatic during builds\n- Fix all type errors before deploying\n\n**Test Sample Collection:**\nThe proxy can collect real request samples for test development:\n\n- Enable with `COLLECT_TEST_SAMPLES=true`\n- Samples are stored in `test-samples/` directory\n- Each request type gets its own file (e.g., `inference_streaming_opus.json`)\n- Sensitive data is automatically masked\n- Samples include headers, body, and metadata\n\n**Tests:**\nCurrently no automated tests. When implementing:\n\n- Use Bun's built-in test runner\n- Test proxy logic, telemetry, token tracking\n- Test both streaming and non-streaming responses\n- Use collected samples as test data\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- Uses Bun runtime exclusively (no Node.js)\n- Separate Docker images for each service\n- TypeScript compilation for production builds\n- Model-agnostic (accepts any model name)\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Add Domain Credentials\n\n```bash\n# Generate secure client API key\nbun run scripts/generate-api-key.ts\n\n# Create credential file\ncat > credentials/domain.com.credentials.json << EOF\n{\n  \"type\": \"api_key\",\n  \"api_key\": \"sk-ant-...\",\n  \"client_api_key\": \"cnp_live_...\"\n}\nEOF\n```\n\n### Enable Storage\n\n```bash\nexport STORAGE_ENABLED=true\nexport DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...\n```\n\n### View Token Stats\n\n```bash\ncurl http://localhost:3000/token-stats\n```\n\n### Access Dashboard\n\n```bash\nopen http://localhost:3001\n# Use DASHBOARD_API_KEY for authentication\n```\n\n# important-instruction-reminders\nDo what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.\nNEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.\nALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.\nNEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n\n      \n      IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. You should not respond to this context or otherwise consider it in your response unless it is highly relevant to your task. Most of the time, it is not relevant.\n</system-reminder>\n"

        "description": "Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session with optional timeout, ensuring proper handling and security measures.\n\nBefore executing the command, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use the LS tool to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use LS to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes).\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n  - If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you.\n  - VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like `find` and `grep`. Instead use Grep, Glob, or Task to search. You MUST avoid read tools like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, and `ls`, and use Read and LS to read files.\n  - If you _still_ need to run `grep`, STOP. ALWAYS USE ripgrep at `rg` first, which all Claude Code users have pre-installed.\n  - When issuing multiple commands, use the ';' or '&&' operator to separate them. DO NOT use newlines (newlines are ok in quoted strings).\n  - Try to maintain your current working directory throughout the session by using absolute paths and avoiding usage of `cd`. You may use `cd` if the User explicitly requests it.\n    <good-example>\n    pytest /foo/bar/tests\n    </good-example>\n    <bad-example>\n    cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n    </bad-example>\n\n\n\n\n# Committing changes with git\n\nWhen the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following bash commands in parallel, each using the Bash tool:\n  - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n  - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n  - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n  - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n  - Check for any sensitive information that shouldn't be committed\n  - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n  - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Create the commit with a message ending with:\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   - Run git status to make sure the commit succeeded.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook changes, retry the commit ONCE to include these automated changes. If it fails again, it usually means a pre-commit hook is preventing the commit. If the commit succeeds but you notice that files were modified by the pre-commit hook, you MUST amend your commit to include them.\n\nImportant notes:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git bash commands\n- NEVER use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n<example>\ngit commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n   Commit message here.\n\n   🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n   EOF\n   )\"\n</example>\n\n# Creating pull requests\nUse the gh command via the Bash tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following bash commands in parallel using the Bash tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following commands in parallel:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to ensure correct formatting.\n<example>\ngh pr create --title \"the pr title\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n<1-3 bullet points>\n\n## Test plan\n[Checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\nEOF\n)\"\n</example>\n\nImportant:\n- NEVER update the git config\n- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it\n\n# Other common operations\n- View comments on a Github PR: gh api repos/foo/bar/pulls/123/comments",

When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as Claude Code is a multimodal LLM.\n- For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), use the NotebookRead instead\n- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful. \n- You will regularly be asked to read screenshots. If the user provides a path to a screenshot ALWAYS use this tool to view the file at the path. This tool will work with all temporary file paths like /var/folders/123/abc/T/TemporaryItems/NSIRD_screencaptureui_ZfB1tD/Screenshot.png\n- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.",

It is built on top of the Edit tool and allows you to perform multiple find-and-replace operations efficiently. Prefer this tool over the Edit tool when you need to make multiple edits to the same file.\n\nBefore using this tool:\n\n1. Use the Read tool to understand the file's contents and context\n2. Verify the directory path is correct\n\nTo make multiple file edits, provide the following:\n1. file_path: The absolute path to the file to modify (must be absolute, not relative)\n2. edits: An array of edit operations to perform, where each edit contains:\n   - old_string: The text to replace (must match the file contents exactly, including all whitespace and indentation)\n   - new_string: The edited text to replace the old_string\n   - replace_all: Replace all occurences of old_string. This parameter is optional and defaults to false.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- All edits are applied in sequence, in the order they are provided\n- Each edit operates on the result of the previous edit\n- All edits must be valid for the operation to succeed - if any edit fails, none will be applied\n- This tool is ideal when you need to make several changes to different parts of the same file\n- For Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files), use the NotebookEdit instead\n\nCRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:\n1. All edits follow the same requirements as the single Edit tool\n2. The edits are atomic - either all succeed or none are applied\n3. Plan your edits carefully to avoid conflicts between sequential operations\n\nWARNING:\n- The tool will fail if edits.old_string doesn't match the file contents exactly (including whitespace)\n- The tool will fail if edits.old_string and edits.new_string are the same\n- Since edits are applied in sequence, ensure that earlier edits don't affect the text that later edits are trying to find\n\nWhen making edits:\n- Ensure all edits result in idiomatic, correct code\n- Do not leave the code in a broken state\n- Always use absolute file paths (starting with /)\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n- Use replace_all for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.\n\nIf you want to create a new file, use:\n- A new file path, including dir name if needed\n- First edit: empty old_string and the new file's contents as new_string\n- Subsequent edits: normal edit operations on the created content",

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implement memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Add virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimize image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fix state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Review bundle size and implement code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n",

Comprehensive pre-commit validation that catches bugs, security issues, incomplete implementations, and ensures changes match the original requirements.

Use this before committing, when reviewing changes, checking your changes, validating changes, or when you're about to commit or ready to commit. Claude should proactively suggest using this tool whenever the user mentions committing or when changes are complete. When original request context is unavailable, Claude MUST think deeply about implementation intent, analyze patterns across modifications, infer business logic and requirements from code changes, and provide comprehensive insights about what was accomplished and completion status. Choose thinking_mode based on changeset size: 'low' for small focused changes, 'medium' for standard commits (default), 'high' for large feature branches or complex refactoring, 'max' for critical releases or when reviewing extensive changes across multiple systems. Note: If you're not currently using a top-tier model such as Opus 4 or above, these tools can provide enhanced capabilities.",
