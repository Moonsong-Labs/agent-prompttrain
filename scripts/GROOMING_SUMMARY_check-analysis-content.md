# Grooming Summary: check-analysis-content.ts

## Date: 2025-01-19

## File Purpose

This utility script queries the database to display the content of AI analysis for a specific conversation, including both structured data and raw text. It's documented in CLAUDE.md as one of the AI analysis utility scripts.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Proper CLI Interface

- Added comprehensive argument parsing with `--help`, `--verbose`, `--format`, and `--branch` options
- Removed hardcoded default conversation ID
- Made conversation ID a required positional argument
- Added UUID format validation

### 2. Improved Type Safety

- Added proper TypeScript interface for `AnalysisContent` query results
- Used `ConversationAnalysisStatus` type from shared package
- Added proper typing for all functions and parameters

### 3. Enhanced Consistency

- Switched from raw `dotenv` to `@claude-nexus/shared` config for consistency with other scripts
- Structured code similar to `check-analysis-jobs.ts` for uniformity
- Added proper error handling with helpful messages for common issues

### 4. Added Features

- **Branch filtering**: Can now filter analyses by specific branch ID
- **JSON output format**: Added `--format json` option for scripting integration
- **Verbose mode**: Shows full content and additional details when `--verbose` is used
- **Better error display**: Properly formats error messages including JSON objects

### 5. Improved User Experience

- Clear help documentation with usage examples
- Validation of inputs before database connection
- Helpful error messages for common issues (connection refused, auth failed, missing table)
- Consistent exit codes for different error scenarios

## Rationale

The refactoring was necessary to bring this utility script up to the same quality standard as other scripts in the project (e.g., `check-analysis-jobs.ts`). The original script was functional but lacked the polish and features expected from a production-ready CLI tool.

The changes improve:

- **Usability**: Clear CLI interface with help documentation
- **Maintainability**: Consistent code structure and configuration approach
- **Reliability**: Proper error handling and input validation
- **Flexibility**: Support for different output formats and filtering options

## Testing

All changes were tested for:

- Help flag functionality
- Error handling for missing arguments
- UUID validation
- TypeScript compilation

No ADR was created as this is a straightforward refactoring that follows established patterns in the codebase.
