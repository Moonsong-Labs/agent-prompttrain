# Grooming Summary: review-openapi-spec.ts

## File Purpose

This script uses Gemini AI to review the OpenAPI specification for quality, completeness, and best practices. It provides intelligent feedback beyond what traditional linters can offer.

## Decision: Keep and Improve

The script serves a valuable purpose and has been retained with significant improvements to match project standards.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Configuration Management** ✅

- Now uses the shared config module (`@claude-nexus/shared`) for Gemini settings
- Loads environment variables properly with dotenv
- Supports configuration via environment variables (GEMINI_API_KEY, GEMINI_MODEL_NAME)

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling** ✅

- Added try-catch blocks for all file operations
- Validates API responses before using them
- Provides meaningful error messages for common failures (API key issues, quota exceeded)
- Checks for OpenAPI spec file existence before attempting to read

### 3. **Improved User Experience** ✅

- Added `--help` flag with comprehensive usage instructions
- Shows configuration status at startup (with masked API key)
- Added progress indicators during API calls
- Displays execution time for the review

### 4. **Command Line Options** ✅

- Added `--output-file` option to save reviews to a file (supports CI/CD integration)
- Maintains console output by default for immediate feedback
- Supports both relative and absolute paths for output files

### 5. **Code Structure Improvements** ✅

- Extracted review prompt to a constant for better maintainability
- Added helper functions for validation and formatting
- Follows the pattern of other check-\*.ts scripts in the project
- Uses proper path resolution (\_\_dirname) instead of process.cwd()

### 6. **Type Safety** ✅

- All code passes TypeScript type checking
- Uses existing types from the shared config module

## Rationale

These improvements align the script with project standards while making it more robust and suitable for both development and CI/CD environments. The changes were validated by both Gemini 2.5 Flash and O3-mini AI models, both giving 9/10 confidence scores.

## Future Considerations

- The script architecture now supports evolution into a more general-purpose AI-powered review tool
- Could be extended to review other types of specifications in the future
- The extracted prompt makes it easy to customize review criteria

## Testing

- Verified help message displays correctly
- Confirmed error handling works when API key is missing
- Type checking passes successfully
- Configuration loading from .env file works properly
