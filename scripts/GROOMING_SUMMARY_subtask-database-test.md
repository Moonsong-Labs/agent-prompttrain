# Grooming Summary: test/unit/subtask-database.test.ts

**Date**: 2025-01-21  
**Action**: Deleted file  
**Reviewed by**: Claude with validation from Gemini 2.5 Pro and O3 Mini

## Summary

Removed obsolete test file `test/unit/subtask-database.test.ts` that was testing outdated implementation patterns.

## Issues Identified

1. **Testing Outdated Implementation**: The file tested StorageWriter's subtask detection logic which has been moved to ConversationLinker
2. **Anti-pattern**: Tests accessed private methods using type assertions (`(writer as any).findMatchingTaskInvocation()`)
3. **Wrong Location**: Test was in generic `test/unit/` folder instead of service-specific location
4. **Heavy Mocking**: Extensive mocking of PostgreSQL Pool made tests brittle and maintenance-heavy
5. **Duplication**: Comprehensive subtask detection tests already exist in `packages/shared/src/utils/__tests__/subtask-detection.test.ts`

## Action Taken

Deleted the entire file after confirming:

- Subtask detection is now handled by ConversationLinker with SubtaskQueryExecutor pattern (per CLAUDE.md)
- Comprehensive tests exist in the shared package covering all scenarios
- Integration tests (`test/integration/subtask-linking.test.ts`) provide end-to-end coverage
- The `storeTaskToolInvocations` method is a simple UPDATE query that doesn't require complex unit testing

## Validation

- Gemini 2.5 Pro: Agreed with deletion, recommended sanity check for unique test scenarios (completed)
- O3 Mini: Confirmed deletion aligns with best practices for removing outdated, brittle tests
- Unit tests continue to pass after deletion
- Subtask detection tests in shared package are comprehensive and passing

## Impact

- Reduced maintenance burden by removing obsolete tests
- Eliminated confusion from tests that don't match current implementation
- Improved code clarity by removing anti-patterns
- No loss of test coverage as functionality is tested elsewhere
