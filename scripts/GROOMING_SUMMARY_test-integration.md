# Grooming Summary: test-integration.sh

**Date**: 2025-01-19
**File**: scripts/test-integration.sh
**Action**: REMOVED

## Rationale

The `test-integration.sh` script was identified as redundant and problematic:

1. **Referenced non-existent test**: The script referenced `proxy-auth.test.ts` which doesn't exist in the codebase
2. **Minimal value**: Only ran one actual test file (`ai-analysis-api.test.ts`)
3. **Unnecessary indirection**: Added complexity without providing any real benefit

## Changes Made

1. **Removed the script**: Deleted `scripts/test-integration.sh`
2. **Updated package.json**:
   - Changed `test:ci` to run integration tests directly: `bun test tests/integration/`
   - Changed `test:integration` to run integration tests directly: `bun test tests/integration/`

## Benefits

- Simplified test execution flow
- Removed confusion from non-existent test reference
- Better scalability - any new tests added to `tests/integration/` will automatically be included
- Reduced maintenance overhead

## Testing

Both `bun run test:integration` and `bun run test:ci` were tested and continue to work correctly, running all integration tests as expected.
