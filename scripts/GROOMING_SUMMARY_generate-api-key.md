# Grooming Summary: generate-api-key.ts

**Date**: 2025-01-19
**File**: `scripts/auth/generate-api-key.ts`
**Branch**: `file-grooming-07-18`

## Overview

Refactored the API key generation script to improve type safety, security, maintainability, and error handling while keeping it simple and dependency-free.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Type Safety Improvements**

- Added `CLIOptions` interface for structured option handling
- Added proper return type annotations to all functions
- Used const assertions for error messages
- Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation with examples

### 2. **Security Enhancements**

- Implemented prefix validation with regex pattern `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,32}$/`
- Prevents injection attacks by only allowing safe characters
- Added maximum prefix length constraint (32 characters)
- Added proper error handling for crypto operations

### 3. **Code Organization**

- Extracted all magic values to named constants
- Separated concerns: CLI parsing, key generation, and display logic
- Created dedicated functions for each responsibility
- Improved error messages with clear, actionable feedback

### 4. **Error Handling**

- Added try-catch blocks around crypto operations
- Validates count range (1-100) to prevent abuse
- Provides specific error messages for each failure case
- Gracefully exits with appropriate error codes

### 5. **Documentation**

- Added JSDoc comments to all exported functions
- Included usage examples in documentation
- Enhanced help message with security notes
- Documented parameter constraints

## Testing Results

All functionality tested and verified:

- ✅ Basic key generation
- ✅ Test key generation with `--test`
- ✅ Multiple key generation
- ✅ Custom prefix support
- ✅ Invalid prefix rejection
- ✅ Count validation
- ✅ Help display
- ✅ npm script alias works

## Security Improvements

1. **Input Validation**: Prevents injection by restricting prefix characters
2. **Error Masking**: Generic error messages prevent information leakage
3. **Bounds Checking**: Limits count to prevent resource exhaustion
4. **Consistent Entropy**: Maintains 256-bit entropy (32 bytes)

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing functionality preserved
- Command-line interface unchanged
- Export interface unchanged
- No breaking changes

## Future Considerations

1. Could add unit tests when test framework is set up
2. Could add rate limiting if exposed as an API
3. Could add duplicate key detection if storing keys
4. Current implementation is solid for CLI usage

## Conclusion

The refactored script is now more secure, maintainable, and follows TypeScript best practices while remaining simple and focused on its core purpose.
