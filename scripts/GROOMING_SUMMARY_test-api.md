# Grooming Summary: test-api.sh

## Date: 2025-01-19

## File: `test-api.sh`

## Action Taken: **NO ACTION - FILE NOT FOUND**

## Investigation Summary

During the grooming process for `test-api.sh`, the following was discovered:

1. **File Does Not Exist**: The file `test-api.sh` was not found anywhere in the project structure
2. **Related Files Already Groomed**: A similar file `test-dashboard-api.sh` was previously removed during grooming (see GROOMING_SUMMARY_test-dashboard-api.md)
3. **Pattern Suggests Prior Removal**: Based on the grooming pattern for similar test API scripts, this file was likely already removed in a previous grooming session

## Historical Context

Based on the grooming summary for `test-dashboard-api.sh`, manual test API scripts have been systematically removed from the project because:

- They represent technical debt with no production value
- They use hardcoded values and manual curl commands
- They provide no actual test coverage or assertions
- They've been replaced by proper automated test suites

## Conclusion

No action required. The file appears to have been already removed as part of the ongoing effort to clean up manual test scripts and replace them with automated testing infrastructure.

## Recommendation

If manual API testing is needed during development, developers should:
1. Use proper automated test suites (`bun test`)
2. Create temporary test files that are not committed to the repository
3. Use development tools like Postman or similar API testing tools
4. Rely on the existing test infrastructure rather than creating manual scripts
