### Summary of Changes

Refactored the AI worker configuration check script to improve type safety, validation, and user experience.

### Key Improvements

1. **Type Safety**:
   - Replaced direct `process.env` access with typed configuration from `@claude-nexus/shared`
   - Ensures consistency with the main application configuration

2. **Comprehensive Configuration Display**:
   - Added display of all AI worker-related configuration values
   - Organized output into logical sections: Core Configuration, Worker Settings, and Prompt Engineering

3. **Input Validation**:
   - Added validation for positive numbers (poll interval, concurrent jobs, timeout)
   - Added warnings for potentially problematic configurations (e.g., poll interval < 1 second)

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implemented sensitive value masking for API keys (shows first 4 chars only)
   - Prevents accidental exposure of credentials in logs

5. **Better User Experience**:
   - Clearer error messages with actionable fixes
   - Warning system for non-critical issues
   - Exit codes for CI/CD integration (0 for success, 1 for errors)

6. **Code Organization**:
   - Added helper functions for common operations (masking, formatting, validation)
   - Improved readability with structured output sections

### Rationale

This refactoring transforms a basic diagnostic script into a production-ready tool that:

- Provides comprehensive visibility into AI worker configuration
- Catches configuration errors early in development/deployment
- Integrates seamlessly with CI/CD pipelines
- Maintains consistency with the project's type system
- Follows security best practices for credential handling

### Testing

Tested various scenarios:

- Normal operation with valid configuration ✓
- Missing API key error handling ✓
- Low poll interval warning ✓
- Exit codes for success/failure ✓

No ADR required as this is an enhancement to an existing utility script without architectural changes.
