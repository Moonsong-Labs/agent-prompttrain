# Grooming Summary: dev-dashboard.sh

## Date: 2025-07-19

## Files Affected

- Deleted: `scripts/dev/dev-dashboard.sh`
- Deleted: `scripts/dev/dev-proxy.sh`
- Modified: `package.json`
- Modified: `scripts/README.md`
- Deleted: `scripts/GROOMING_SUMMARY_dev-proxy-scripts.md` (outdated)

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Redundant Shell Scripts

- Deleted `dev-dashboard.sh` and `dev-proxy.sh` which were 95% identical
- These scripts violated DRY principles and added unnecessary complexity

### 2. Simplified package.json Scripts

Updated the root `package.json` to directly run services:

```json
"dev:proxy": "cd services/proxy && bun run dev",
"dev:dashboard": "cd services/dashboard && bun run dev",
```

### 3. Updated Documentation

- Removed references to deleted scripts from `scripts/README.md`
- Removed outdated grooming summary file

## Rationale

1. **Eliminated Code Duplication**: The two shell scripts were nearly identical, violating DRY principles.

2. **Leveraged Bun's Built-in Features**: Bun automatically loads `.env` files, making the environment variable loading in the shell scripts redundant.

3. **Simplified Developer Experience**: Developers can now use standard `bun run` commands without dealing with shell script layers.

4. **Reduced Maintenance Burden**: Fewer files to maintain, and the logic is centralized in `package.json`.

5. **Aligned with Project Philosophy**: The project values simplicity over complexity, and this change removes unnecessary abstraction.

## Testing

- Verified `bun run dev:dashboard` works correctly
- Verified `bun run dev:proxy` works correctly
- Both services start successfully with environment variables loaded

## Impact

- No breaking changes for developers
- The same commands (`bun run dev:proxy`, `bun run dev:dashboard`, `bun run dev`) continue to work
- Slightly faster startup time by removing shell script overhead

## Recommendations

This pattern of simplification could be applied to other scripts in the project that merely wrap simple commands.
