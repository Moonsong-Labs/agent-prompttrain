# Grooming Summary: scripts/README.md

**Date:** 2025-01-19
**Branch:** file-grooming-07-18

## Summary

Updated the scripts/README.md documentation to accurately reflect the current state of the scripts directory.

## Issues Found

1. **Outdated documentation**: Several scripts were documented but no longer existed
   - `generate-conversation-test.ts` - removed from documentation
   - Empty `database/` directory reference - removed

2. **Missing documentation**: Many existing scripts were not documented
   - AI Analysis scripts (check-ai-worker-config.ts, etc.)
   - Database utility scripts (copy-conversation.ts, analyze-request-linking.ts)
   - Additional test scripts (test-sample-collection.sh)
   - SQL files (find-conversations-not-starting-at-1.sql)

3. **Directory structure mismatch**: The documented structure didn't match reality
   - Added archived-migrations directory reference
   - Added root-level scripts notation

## Changes Made

1. **Updated directory structure** to accurately reflect the current layout
2. **Added new sections**:
   - AI Analysis Scripts - for AI worker and analysis tools
   - Database Utility Scripts - for conversation copying and other utilities
   - Other Utility Scripts - for miscellaneous tools
3. **Removed obsolete documentation** for non-existent scripts
4. **Added documentation** for all previously undocumented scripts
5. **Added note** about GROOMING_SUMMARY files in the directory

## Validation

- Verified all documented scripts exist in the filesystem
- Ensured all existing scripts are now documented
- Confirmed directory structure matches reality
- Validated with Gemini-2.5-pro (10/10 confidence) for the refactoring approach

## Impact

- **Developer Experience**: Significantly improved by eliminating confusion from outdated docs
- **Discoverability**: All utility scripts are now documented and discoverable
- **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain with accurate, complete documentation
- **Organization**: Better organized by functionality rather than just directory structure

## Follow-up Recommendations

As suggested by Gemini validation:

- Establish a policy requiring documentation updates alongside script additions/modifications
- Consider adding this requirement to PR review checklist
- Monitor for documentation drift in future sprints
