# Grooming Summary: test-dashboard-api.sh

## Date: 2025-01-19

## File: `scripts/dev/test/test-dashboard-api.sh`

## Action Taken: **DELETED**

## Rationale

This file was a manual bash script for testing dashboard API endpoints. After analysis and validation with AI models, it was determined that:

1. **Technical Debt**: Manual test scripts are technical debt that provide no value in production
2. **No Test Coverage**: The script only used curl commands with jq/grep, providing no actual test assertions
3. **Hardcoded Values**: Used hardcoded API key ("alan") and localhost URL
4. **Outdated Approach**: Modern development should rely on automated test suites, not manual scripts
5. **Redundancy**: Proper automated tests already exist in the project test suite

## Changes Made

1. **Deleted** `scripts/dev/test/test-dashboard-api.sh`
2. **Updated** `scripts/README.md` to:
   - Remove incorrect directory structure showing `scripts/test/`
   - Remove the "Test Scripts" section documenting these manual scripts
3. **Updated** `docs/01-Getting-Started/development.md` to:
   - Remove references to manual test scripts
   - Replace with proper `bun test` command

## Validation

- Confirmed with Gemini-2.5-pro (9/10 confidence) that deletion is the correct action
- Verified that proper test files exist in the project structure
- Ensured no critical test coverage was lost

## Best Practice Reinforced

This grooming action reinforces that:

- Developer convenience scripts are temporary and should be removed once replaced by automated tests
- The automated test suite is the canonical source for test cases
- Manual test scripts become outdated and create confusion
