# Grooming Summary: dev-proxy.sh and dev-dashboard.sh

## Date: 2025-01-19

## Files Modified

- `scripts/dev/dev-proxy.sh`
- `scripts/dev/dev-dashboard.sh`

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing error handling**: Scripts used unsafe bash practices without `set -e`
2. **Unsafe environment loading**: Used `export $(cat .env | grep -v '^#' | xargs)` which fails with special characters
3. **No documentation**: Scripts lacked purpose, usage, and inline comments
4. **Location dependency**: Scripts only worked when run from project root
5. **No dependency checks**: Didn't verify if `bun` was installed
6. **Inconsistent with other scripts**: Other scripts in the project had better structure

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Strict Error Handling

- Added `set -euo pipefail` for immediate exit on errors
- Added error trap with line number reporting for debugging

### 2. Improved Environment Loading

- Replaced unsafe `cat | grep | xargs` with `set -a` and `source`
- Added proper file existence check with user-friendly warnings

### 3. Made Scripts Location-Independent

- Scripts now determine their own location and project root
- Can be run from any directory, not just project root
- Useful for cron jobs, CI/CD, or when called from other scripts

### 4. Added Comprehensive Documentation

- Header comments explaining purpose and usage
- Inline comments for each major section
- Clear error messages guiding users on fixes

### 5. Added Dependency Checks

- Verifies `bun` is installed before attempting to use it
- Provides helpful error message with installation link

### 6. Improved Directory Navigation

- Validates directories exist before changing to them
- Clear error messages if directories are missing

### 7. Used `exec` for Final Command

- Replaces shell process with bun process for cleaner process management

## Benefits

- **Reliability**: Scripts now fail fast with clear error messages
- **Maintainability**: Well-documented and consistent with best practices
- **Flexibility**: Can be run from anywhere, making them more versatile
- **Security**: Safer environment variable loading
- **User Experience**: Better error messages help users troubleshoot

## Testing

- Syntax validation passed for both scripts
- Successfully tested location independence
- Scripts properly load environment and start services

## Rationale

These changes align with shell scripting best practices for production-ready code. The improvements make the scripts more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly while maintaining backward compatibility with existing usage patterns.
