## 2025-01-21: Technical Debt Document Refactoring

### File: `docs/04-Architecture/technical-debt.md`

#### Changes Made:

1. **Added summary table**: Created a quick-reference table at the top showing all active debt items with their priority, effort, and target dates.

2. **Standardized format**: All active debt items now follow a consistent structure with metadata fields (Priority, Effort, Status, Location, First Identified, Target Date).

3. **Moved resolved items**: Created a "Resolution History" section to separate completed work from active debt, reducing clutter.

4. **Removed verbose code examples**: Replaced lengthy code snippets with brief remediation descriptions to improve scannability.

5. **Consolidated duplicate sections**: Merged "Recent Progress" and "Recent Grooming Progress" into the Resolution History.

6. **Added tracking metrics**: Introduced clear targets for debt management (e.g., â‰¤2 high priority items, <90 days age for high priority).

#### Rationale:

These changes transform the technical debt register from a historical document into an actionable planning tool:

- **Better for sprint planning**: Summary table and standardized format make it easy to select items for sprints
- **Improved tracking**: Clear metrics and targets enable better debt management
- **Reduced noise**: Separation of resolved items keeps focus on what needs attention
- **Easier maintenance**: Consistent format makes it simple to add new items

#### AI Consensus:

Both Gemini-2.5-pro and O3-mini strongly endorsed this refactoring approach:

- Gemini suggested a formal template and moving architectural considerations to separate docs
- O3-mini emphasized the value for sprint planning and recommended defining a template

#### Next Steps:

Consider creating an ADR for technical debt management process to formalize the approach and template for new debt items.

## 2025-01-20: JsonRpcHandler.ts Refactoring

### File: `services/proxy/src/mcp/JsonRpcHandler.ts`

#### Changes Made:

1. **Removed redundant outer try-catch**: Simplified error handling structure by removing the duplicate error handling logic that was already covered by inner blocks.

2. **Improved type safety**: Added `extractRequestId()` helper method for safer ID extraction instead of unsafe type casting.

3. **Security improvement**: Stack traces are now only logged when `config.features.debug` is true, preventing sensitive information exposure in production.

4. **JSON-RPC spec compliance**:
   - Updated `isValidJsonRpcRequest()` to accept null IDs as valid per spec
   - Modified `createErrorResponse()` to preserve null IDs instead of defaulting to 0
   - Updated `JsonRpcResponse` type to allow null IDs in error responses

5. **Better error handling**: Consolidated error response logic and improved type narrowing.

#### Related Files Updated:

- `services/proxy/src/mcp/types/protocol.ts`: Updated `JsonRpcResponse` interface to allow null ID per JSON-RPC 2.0 spec

#### Rationale:

These changes improve the production-readiness of the JSON-RPC handler by:

- Following JSON-RPC 2.0 specification more closely
- Preventing security issues with stack trace exposure
- Improving type safety and reducing runtime errors
- Simplifying the code structure for better maintainability

#### Testing:

The refactored code maintains the same functionality while being more robust and secure. The MCP server functionality remains unchanged from an external perspective.
