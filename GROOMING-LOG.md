# Grooming Log

## 2025-01-20: JsonRpcHandler.ts Refactoring

### File: `services/proxy/src/mcp/JsonRpcHandler.ts`

#### Changes Made:

1. **Removed redundant outer try-catch**: Simplified error handling structure by removing the duplicate error handling logic that was already covered by inner blocks.

2. **Improved type safety**: Added `extractRequestId()` helper method for safer ID extraction instead of unsafe type casting.

3. **Security improvement**: Stack traces are now only logged when `config.features.debug` is true, preventing sensitive information exposure in production.

4. **JSON-RPC spec compliance**:
   - Updated `isValidJsonRpcRequest()` to accept null IDs as valid per spec
   - Modified `createErrorResponse()` to preserve null IDs instead of defaulting to 0
   - Updated `JsonRpcResponse` type to allow null IDs in error responses

5. **Better error handling**: Consolidated error response logic and improved type narrowing.

#### Related Files Updated:

- `services/proxy/src/mcp/types/protocol.ts`: Updated `JsonRpcResponse` interface to allow null ID per JSON-RPC 2.0 spec

#### Rationale:

These changes improve the production-readiness of the JSON-RPC handler by:

- Following JSON-RPC 2.0 specification more closely
- Preventing security issues with stack trace exposure
- Improving type safety and reducing runtime errors
- Simplifying the code structure for better maintainability

#### Testing:

The refactored code maintains the same functionality while being more robust and secure. The MCP server functionality remains unchanged from an external perspective.
