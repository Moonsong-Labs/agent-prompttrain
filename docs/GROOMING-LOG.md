## 2025-01-20: Refactor overview.ts

### File: services/dashboard/src/routes/overview.ts

**Summary**: Refactored the overview route to improve code quality, maintainability, and consistency.

### Changes Made:

1. **Extracted Type Definitions**
   - Added `ConversationBranch` interface to `types/conversation.ts`
   - Added `BranchDisplayInfo` interface for branch display logic

2. **Created Constants File**
   - Created `constants/overview.ts` with all magic numbers
   - Replaced hardcoded values throughout the file

3. **Extracted Helper Functions**
   - Created `utils/conversation-display.ts` with:
     - `getBranchDisplayInfo()` - Encapsulates branch display logic
     - `renderBatteryIndicator()` - Renders context usage indicator
     - `generatePageNumbers()` - Handles pagination display
   - Created `utils/overview-data.ts` with:
     - `calculateConversationStats()` - Calculates totals and unique values
     - `filterConversations()` - Handles search filtering
     - `sortConversationsByRecent()` - Sorts by date
     - `paginateConversations()` - Handles pagination logic

4. **Simplified Main Route Handler**
   - Removed complex inline IIFE blocks
   - Replaced inline calculations with helper function calls
   - Made the code more readable and maintainable

### Benefits:

- Better separation of concerns
- Improved testability (functions can be unit tested)
- Reduced complexity in the main route handler
- Type safety with proper interfaces
- Reusable utility functions
- Consistent naming and structure

### Testing:

- TypeScript compilation passes
- Build process completes successfully
- Dashboard service starts without errors
