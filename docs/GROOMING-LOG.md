## 2025-01-21: API Reference Documentation Refactoring

### File: docs/02-User-Guide/api-reference.md

**Summary**: Refactored the API reference documentation to accurately reflect the current implementation and fix discrepancies.

### Issues Found:

1. **Service Architecture Mismatch**: Docs said Dashboard API was on port 3001, but all `/api/*` endpoints are served by proxy on port 3000
2. **Wrong Authentication Headers**: Docs showed `Authorization: Bearer` but implementation uses `X-Dashboard-Key` as primary
3. **Non-existent Endpoints**: Rate limits and SSE endpoints were documented but not implemented
4. **Missing Documentation**: `/api/domains` endpoint existed in code but wasn't documented

### Changes Made:

1. **Fixed Service Architecture**
   - Added note that all API endpoints are served from the same base URL
   - Removed misleading separate Dashboard base URL section

2. **Updated Authentication Documentation**
   - Changed to show `X-Dashboard-Key` as primary header
   - Listed `Authorization: Bearer` and `X-API-Key` as alternatives

3. **Reorganized Endpoints**
   - Grouped into logical sections: Request & Conversation History, Conversation Analysis, Analytics & Usage
   - Changed from flat list to hierarchical structure with proper headings

4. **Added Missing Endpoint**
   - Documented `/api/domains` under Analytics & Usage section

5. **Handled Unimplemented Features**
   - Removed rate limiting and SSE endpoints from main documentation
   - Added "Planned Features" section at the end for these endpoints

### Benefits:

- Documentation now accurately reflects implementation
- Developers won't waste time on non-existent endpoints
- Better organized structure for easier navigation
- Clear distinction between implemented and planned features

## 2025-01-20: Refactor overview.ts

### File: services/dashboard/src/routes/overview.ts

**Summary**: Refactored the overview route to improve code quality, maintainability, and consistency.

### Changes Made:

1. **Extracted Type Definitions**
   - Added `ConversationBranch` interface to `types/conversation.ts`
   - Added `BranchDisplayInfo` interface for branch display logic

2. **Created Constants File**
   - Created `constants/overview.ts` with all magic numbers
   - Replaced hardcoded values throughout the file

3. **Extracted Helper Functions**
   - Created `utils/conversation-display.ts` with:
     - `getBranchDisplayInfo()` - Encapsulates branch display logic
     - `renderBatteryIndicator()` - Renders context usage indicator
     - `generatePageNumbers()` - Handles pagination display
   - Created `utils/overview-data.ts` with:
     - `calculateConversationStats()` - Calculates totals and unique values
     - `filterConversations()` - Handles search filtering
     - `sortConversationsByRecent()` - Sorts by date
     - `paginateConversations()` - Handles pagination logic

4. **Simplified Main Route Handler**
   - Removed complex inline IIFE blocks
   - Replaced inline calculations with helper function calls
   - Made the code more readable and maintainable

### Benefits:

- Better separation of concerns
- Improved testability (functions can be unit tested)
- Reduced complexity in the main route handler
- Type safety with proper interfaces
- Reusable utility functions
- Consistent naming and structure

### Testing:

- TypeScript compilation passes
- Build process completes successfully
- Dashboard service starts without errors
