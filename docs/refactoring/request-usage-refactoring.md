# Request Usage Refactoring Documentation

## Date: 2025-07-20

## File: `services/dashboard/src/routes/request-usage.ts`

## Summary

Refactored the request-usage.ts file to improve code quality, maintainability, and follow TypeScript best practices. The main focus was extracting large inline JavaScript blocks (600+ lines) into modular, reusable components.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Utility Modules

#### `utils/chart-constants.ts`

- Extracted hard-coded color palette (20 colors) into a reusable constant
- Centralized chart configuration (padding, colors, dimensions)
- Improved maintainability and consistency across the application

#### `utils/chart-helpers.ts`

- Extracted helper functions (`getDomainColor`, `formatNumber`)
- Improved code reusability
- Added proper TypeScript types

#### `utils/chart-scripts.ts`

- Extracted 600+ lines of inline JavaScript for chart rendering
- Created a reusable `generateChartScript` function
- Consolidated duplicated logic between request and token charts
- Added proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing functionality

### 2. Refactored Main Route File

- Removed duplicate helper functions
- Created dedicated render functions:
  - `renderRequestChart()` - Handles request chart visualization
  - `renderTokenChart()` - Handles token usage chart visualization
  - `renderSummaryStatistics()` - Handles summary statistics section
- Removed duplicate legend rendering code
- Improved code organization and readability

### 3. Removed Unused Code

- Removed the unused HTMX partial route (`/usage/chart`)
- This route was not referenced anywhere in the codebase
- Simplifies the API surface and reduces maintenance burden

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Chart logic is now in a single, testable module instead of duplicated inline scripts
2. **Type Safety**: Extracted TypeScript modules provide proper type checking
3. **Code Reusability**: Chart rendering logic can now be reused elsewhere if needed
4. **Better Error Handling**: Added try/catch blocks to prevent silent failures
5. **Reduced Duplication**: Consolidated ~600 lines of duplicated code into a single function
6. **Easier Testing**: Modular functions can be unit tested independently
7. **Future-Ready**: Centralizing chart logic makes it easier to migrate to a charting library in the future

## Technical Decisions

1. **Kept Manual Canvas Drawing**: While a charting library would simplify the code further, the refactoring maintains the existing canvas-based approach to minimize risk and ensure backward compatibility
2. **String Replacement Approach**: Used string replacement for dynamic values in generated JavaScript to avoid complex template literal nesting issues
3. **Modular Structure**: Separated concerns into constants, helpers, and script generation to follow single responsibility principle

## Future Improvements

1. **Consider Charting Library**: The centralized chart logic makes it much easier to migrate to Chart.js or similar library in the future
2. **Add Unit Tests**: The extracted modules can now be properly unit tested
3. **TypeScript for Client-Side**: Consider using TypeScript compilation for client-side code instead of generating JavaScript strings

## Validation

- All TypeScript compilation errors were resolved
- Dashboard builds successfully
- No functional changes - charts render identically to before
- Code follows existing project patterns and conventions
