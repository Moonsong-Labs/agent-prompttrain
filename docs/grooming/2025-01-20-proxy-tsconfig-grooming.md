# Proxy TypeScript Configuration Grooming

## Date: 2025-01-20

## Summary

Groomed the `services/proxy/tsconfig.json` file to improve consistency, clarity, and maintainability within the monorepo structure.

## Changes Made

1. **Added JSON Schema**: Added `$schema` field for better IDE support and validation
2. **Improved Documentation**: Added comprehensive header comments explaining the file's purpose
3. **Organized Properties**: Grouped compiler options into logical sections with clear comments
4. **Fixed Test File Handling**: Excluded test files from main compilation path (moved to exclude array)
5. **Enhanced Consistency**: Aligned comment style and structure with other services in the monorepo

## Key Decisions

### Keeping `rootDir: "./"`

- Initially planned to change to `"./src"` but kept as `"./"` because the proxy includes `scripts/**/*` in its compilation
- This differs from shared package but is necessary for the proxy's build structure

### Keeping `esModuleInterop`

- Verification showed this is NOT in the base config, so it must remain in the proxy config
- Added a comment explaining why it's needed

## Technical Validation

The refactoring was validated through:

- Consensus workflow with Gemini-2.5-pro (10/10 confidence) and O3-mini (9/10 confidence)
- TypeScript compilation testing (existing project errors are unrelated to these changes)
- Comparison with other service configurations in the monorepo

## Impact

- **Improved Developer Experience**: Better IDE support through JSON schema
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Clear documentation and logical grouping
- **Consistent Standards**: Aligns with monorepo configuration patterns
- **Correct Test Handling**: Test files properly excluded from main build
