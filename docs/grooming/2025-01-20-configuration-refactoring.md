# Configuration Documentation Refactoring

**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**File**: `docs/01-Getting-Started/configuration.md`

## Summary

Refactored the configuration guide from a duplicative comprehensive reference into a focused quick-start guide that references the existing comprehensive documentation.

## Problems Identified

1. **Significant Duplication**: The configuration.md file duplicated much of the content already present in `docs/06-Reference/environment-vars.md`
2. **Missing Variables**: Many important environment variables were missing, including MCP server config, Spark API, AI analysis settings
3. **Outdated Information**: Referenced non-existent npm scripts and had incorrect variable names (PORT vs PROXY_PORT)
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Having two places documenting the same information creates maintenance overhead

## Changes Made

1. **Converted to Quick Start Guide**:
   - Removed all duplicated environment variable tables
   - Focused on essential setup steps only
   - Added clear references to the comprehensive guide

2. **Improved Structure**:
   - Essential configuration (database, auth, basic .env)
   - Domain credentials setup with correct script paths
   - Database initialization steps
   - Docker quick start
   - Common configuration scenarios
   - Clear next steps and troubleshooting

3. **Fixed References**:
   - Updated script paths to use direct execution (`bun run scripts/auth/generate-api-key.ts`)
   - Fixed authentication guide links to point to correct location
   - Verified all cross-references exist

4. **Added Practical Examples**:
   - Development environment setup
   - Production with all features
   - Clear troubleshooting guidance

## Rationale

Following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, documentation should have a single source of truth. The comprehensive `environment-vars.md` serves as the complete reference, while `configuration.md` now serves as a quick-start guide for new users. This approach:

- Reduces maintenance burden
- Prevents inconsistencies
- Makes it easier for users to find information
- Provides a clear path from quick start to comprehensive documentation

## Impact

- Users get a cleaner, more focused getting-started experience
- Maintainers only need to update environment variables in one place
- Reduced risk of documentation drift
