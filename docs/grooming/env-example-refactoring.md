# .env.example Refactoring Documentation

**Date:** 2025-01-19
**Sprint:** File Grooming
**File:** `.env.example`

## Summary

Refactored the `.env.example` file to be production-ready with comprehensive documentation of all environment variables used in the codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Security Warning
- Added prominent security warning at the top about not committing real credentials
- Used clear placeholder patterns (`REPLACE_ME`, `<brackets>`) for sensitive values

### 2. Restructured Organization
- Created clear sections with visual separators
- Grouped variables logically:
  - Required Settings (must configure)
  - Service Configuration
  - Feature Flags
  - Monitoring & Notifications
  - Optional Features (AI Analysis, MCP, Spark)
  - Advanced Settings (commented out with defaults)

### 3. Added Missing Variables
Added ~30+ environment variables that were in the codebase but missing from .env.example:
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Log verbosity control
- `PROXY_API_URL` - Moved to correct section
- `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` - Telemetry control flag
- `API_KEY_SALT` - Security setting for key hashing
- `CLAUDE_API_TIMEOUT` & `PROXY_SERVER_TIMEOUT` - Request timeouts
- Storage adapter settings
- Rate limiting configurations
- Circuit breaker settings
- Request validation limits
- AI analysis prompt tuning variables
- Spark integration settings

### 4. Improved Documentation
- Added inline comments explaining each variable's purpose
- Included default values for all settings
- Added data type hints (true/false, milliseconds, etc.)
- Provided format examples for complex values (e.g., DATABASE_URL)

### 5. Adopted Hybrid Approach
Based on AI consultation feedback:
- Essential variables are uncommented and ready to fill
- Advanced settings are commented out but documented
- This balances discoverability with avoiding overwhelm

### 6. Security Improvements
- Replaced example API keys with obvious placeholders
- Used `REPLACE_ME` pattern for passwords
- Used `<brackets>` for values that need generation
- Removed any potentially real-looking values

## Rationale

This refactoring ensures:
1. **Completeness**: All environment variables are documented
2. **Security**: No risk of accidentally committing real credentials
3. **Usability**: Clear structure helps users get started quickly
4. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for configuration
5. **Production Readiness**: Suitable for public open-source release

## Testing

- Verified file syntax is valid
- Tested that config module loads without errors
- Confirmed all variables map to actual usage in codebase

## Follow-up Tasks

- Consider creating a `docs/configuration.md` file for detailed explanations
- Update CI/CD to validate .env files against .env.example structure
- Add automated tests to ensure .env.example stays in sync with code
