# Dead Code Removal - January 2025

## Summary

Removed unused type definition file as part of repository grooming efforts.

## Files Removed

### `packages/shared/src/types/hono.ts`

**Reason for Removal:**

- Not imported or used anywhere in the codebase
- Not exported from the shared package's public API
- Redundant with existing comprehensive type definitions in `context.ts`
- Appears to be an early draft that was never integrated

**Original Content:**

```typescript
/**
 * Hono application type definitions
 */

import type { Pool } from 'pg'

// Dashboard service environment
export interface DashboardEnv {
  Variables: {
    apiClient?: any // ProxyApiClient from dashboard service
    domain?: string
  }
}

// Proxy service environment
export interface ProxyEnv {
  Variables: {
    pool?: Pool
    domain?: string
  }
}
```

**Alternative Solution:**
The project already uses `HonoVariables` and `HonoBindings` from `packages/shared/src/types/context.ts` which provide:

- More comprehensive type definitions
- Better documentation
- Actual usage throughout the codebase
- Proper type safety for Hono contexts

## Verification

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes (`bun run typecheck`)
- ✅ Build process completes successfully (`bun run build`)
- ✅ No broken imports or references

## Impact

- **Risk**: None - file was not used
- **Benefits**: Cleaner codebase, reduced confusion, smaller package size
