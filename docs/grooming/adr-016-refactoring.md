# ADR-016 Refactoring Documentation

**Date**: 2025-01-21
**File**: `docs/04-Architecture/ADRs/adr-016-mcp-server-implementation.md`

## Summary

Refactored ADR-016 from 400 lines to 256 lines by removing the "Actual Implementation" section and improving the superseded notice.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Status Section**:
   - Added specific superseded date (2024-12-10)
   - Replaced vague implementation note with clear notice pointing to ADR-017
   - Made it immediately clear this is a rejected proposal

2. **Removed "Actual Implementation" Section**:
   - Deleted 144 lines documenting the actual file-based implementation
   - This content was redundant with ADR-017 and CLAUDE.md
   - Preserved only the original database-backed proposal for historical reference

## Rationale

- **ADR Best Practices**: Superseded ADRs should document the rejected path, not the accepted solution
- **Single Source of Truth**: Implementation details belong in the accepted ADR (ADR-017)
- **Clarity**: Clear separation between rejected proposals and accepted solutions
- **Maintainability**: Reduces documentation drift by avoiding duplicate content

## Validation

- Confirmed ADR-017 contains all essential implementation details
- Verified with AI models (Gemini 2.5 Pro and O3-mini) that this approach follows ADR best practices
- Ensured the historical value of the original proposal is preserved
