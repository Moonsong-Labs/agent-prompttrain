# Conversation Linker Refactoring - January 2025

## Overview

Refactored `packages/shared/src/utils/conversation-linker.ts` to improve code quality, maintainability, and error handling.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Unused Code

- **QUERY_LIMIT constant**: Removed unused constant that was marked as "Reserved for future use"
- **normalizeSummaryForComparison method**: Removed unused private method that was commented out in actual usage

### 2. Merged Duplicate Code

- Combined `computeMessageHash` and `computeMessageHashNoDedupe` methods into a single method with an optional `skipDeduplication` parameter
- This reduces code duplication and makes the API cleaner

### 3. Added JSDoc Documentation

- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to key public methods:
  - `linkConversation` - Main entry point with detailed parameter and return documentation
  - `computeMessageHash` - Documented the hashing functionality and parameters
  - `normalizeMessageContent` - Explained content normalization process
  - `deduplicateMessages` - Documented the deduplication logic and bug reference

### 4. Improved Error Handling

- Created custom `ConversationLinkingError` class that extends Error
- Enhanced error messages with contextual information (e.g., message count, indices)
- Improved error handling in `computeMessageHash` to preserve error context
- Updated validation errors to use the custom error class

## Rationale

### Why These Changes?

1. **Code Cleanliness**: Removing unused code reduces confusion and maintenance burden
2. **DRY Principle**: Merging duplicate methods follows Don't Repeat Yourself principle
3. **Documentation**: JSDoc helps developers understand the code without diving into implementation
4. **Better Debugging**: Custom error class with context makes debugging easier in production

### Why Not Extract Methods?

While the original plan included extracting the large `linkConversation` method into smaller methods, this was deferred because:

- The method, while long, has a clear flow and extensive test coverage
- Breaking it up would require significant refactoring with risk of introducing bugs
- The current improvements provide immediate value with minimal risk
- Future refactoring can be done incrementally when there's a specific need

## Testing

- All 86 tests pass after refactoring
- Updated one test to match the new error message
- No functionality changes, only code quality improvements

## Next Steps

Future improvements could include:

1. Extracting complex logic from `linkConversation` when modifying that functionality
2. Adding more specific error types for different failure scenarios
3. Creating constants file for magic numbers and repeated strings
