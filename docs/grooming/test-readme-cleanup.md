# Test README Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-07-21
**File**: `test/README.md`
**Branch**: `file-grooming-07-18`

## Summary

Removed outdated `test/README.md` file and cleaned up empty test directories as part of repository grooming.

## Issue Identified

The `test/README.md` file was outdated and misleading:

- Described a test structure that doesn't exist (`test/unit/`, `test/fixtures/`)
- Actual tests are distributed across `services/` and `packages/` folders following monorepo pattern
- Empty directories `test/data/` and `test/performance/` served no purpose

## Action Taken

1. **Deleted `test/README.md`** - The file was providing incorrect information about test structure
2. **Deleted empty directories** - Removed `test/data/` and `test/performance/`
3. **Preserved `test/integration/`** - This directory contains actual tests and its own README

## Rationale

- In a monorepo structure, each service/package manages its own tests
- A centralized test README is misleading when tests are distributed
- Empty directories add no value and clutter the project structure
- This change aligns with monorepo best practices

## Validation

- Gemini-2.5-pro validated the plan with 10/10 confidence
- Confirmed alignment with industry standards for monorepo test organization
- Tests continue to pass after cleanup

## Impact

- **Positive**: Removes confusion for developers looking for tests
- **Positive**: Aligns with monorepo best practices
- **Positive**: Reduces maintenance debt
- **Risk**: None - only removed outdated/empty files

## No ADR Required

This is a straightforward cleanup task that doesn't introduce new architectural decisions. The monorepo test structure is already established and documented in the main project documentation.
