# Grooming Log: prompts.ts - 2025-01-20

## File: `services/proxy/src/mcp/types/prompts.ts`

### Summary

Cleaned up the prompts.ts file by removing dead code and improving documentation.

### Changes Made

1. **Removed Dead Code**
   - Deleted the unused `SyncStatus` interface that was not imported or used anywhere in the codebase
   - This interface was redundant as `GitHubSyncService.ts` defines its own `SyncInfo` interface

2. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to the `YamlPromptFormat` interface
   - Documented each property with clear descriptions and usage notes
   - Added example showing Handlebars template syntax

### Rationale

- **Dead Code Removal**: The `SyncStatus` interface was not used anywhere in the codebase, making it technical debt. Removing it improves code clarity and reduces confusion.

- **Documentation Enhancement**: The `YamlPromptFormat` interface is a key type for the MCP prompt system. Proper documentation helps developers understand:
  - How prompt files are structured
  - That the filename overrides the name property
  - The Handlebars templating syntax supported

- **File Organization Decision**: After consulting with AI models, decided to keep `YamlPromptFormat` in its own file rather than moving to `protocol.ts` because:
  - It represents domain-specific prompt formatting, not core protocol types
  - Keeping it separate maintains clear separation of concerns
  - The file can accommodate future prompt-related types

### Impact

- No functional changes - purely documentation and cleanup
- Type safety maintained - verified that `PromptRegistryService` still imports and uses the type correctly
- Improved developer experience through better documentation
