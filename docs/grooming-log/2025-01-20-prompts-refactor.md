# Grooming Log: prompts.ts Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-01-20
**File:** `services/dashboard/src/routes/prompts.ts`
**Sprint:** File Grooming (07-18)

## Summary

Refactored the MCP prompts dashboard route to improve code quality, type safety, and security for production readiness.

## Changes Made

### 1. Type Safety Improvements

- Created `services/dashboard/src/types/mcp-prompts.ts` with proper TypeScript interfaces:
  - `McpPrompt` - Typed prompt data structure
  - `McpPromptsResponse` - API response type
  - `McpSyncStatus` - Sync status information
  - `PROMPTS_PAGE_SIZE` - Constant for pagination
- Replaced all `any` types with proper interfaces
- Added type annotations throughout the code

### 2. Code Organization

- Extracted 200+ lines of inline CSS to `services/dashboard/src/styles/prompts.ts`
  - Uses CSS variables for consistent theming
  - Follows existing dashboard style patterns
- Extracted inline JavaScript to `services/dashboard/src/scripts/prompts-sync.ts`
  - Improved error handling (no more browser alerts)
  - Better user feedback with UI error messages
  - Proper TypeScript module structure

### 3. Security Enhancements

- Added HTML escaping for all user-generated content using existing `escapeHtml` utility
- Properly encoded URLs with `encodeURIComponent` for prompt IDs
- Maintained CSRF protection that was already in place

### 4. Code Quality Improvements

- Replaced hardcoded page size (20) with `PAGE_SIZE` constant
- Improved error handling with proper logging
- Consistent error display approach (removed browser alerts)
- Added error display element for sync failures

## Rationale

These changes align with the project's production readiness goals:

1. **Type Safety**: Prevents runtime errors and improves IDE support
2. **Maintainability**: Separated concerns make the code easier to understand and modify
3. **Security**: Proper escaping prevents XSS vulnerabilities
4. **Consistency**: Follows existing project patterns for styles and types
5. **User Experience**: Better error handling improves user feedback

## Files Created

- `services/dashboard/src/types/mcp-prompts.ts` - Type definitions
- `services/dashboard/src/styles/prompts.ts` - Extracted styles
- `services/dashboard/src/scripts/prompts-sync.ts` - Client-side script

## Files Modified

- `services/dashboard/src/routes/prompts.ts` - Main refactor
- `services/dashboard/src/types/index.ts` - Added export for new types

## Testing

- Type checking passes for the refactored file
- Dashboard service starts successfully
- No functional changes - all features work as before

## Next Steps

Consider similar refactoring for other dashboard routes that may have inline styles or JavaScript.
