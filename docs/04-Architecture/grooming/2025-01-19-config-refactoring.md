# Configuration Module Refactoring

Date: 2025-01-19
File: `packages/shared/src/config/index.ts`

## Summary

Refactored the shared configuration module to improve maintainability, performance, and type safety.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Excessive Getters

- Converted most getter functions to direct property access
- Only kept getters where lazy evaluation is actually needed (when defaults depend on runtime values)
- **Performance impact**: Eliminates function call overhead for each config access

### 2. Consolidated AI Configuration

- Merged `ai-analysis.ts` content into the main config file
- Removed the separate file to reduce complexity
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy exports
- **Benefit**: Single source of truth for all configuration

### 3. Improved Type Safety

- Enhanced env helper functions with better error handling
- Added warning logs for invalid integer parsing
- Added new `json` helper for parsing JSON env vars
- **Benefit**: Earlier detection of configuration errors

### 4. Added Missing Configurations

- Added security configuration section with `apiKeySalt`
- Added dashboard configuration with `apiKey`
- Added missing storage adapter settings
- Added SQL logging configuration options

### 5. Documentation Improvements

- Added inline comments for timeout values
- Clarified configuration purposes
- Fixed incorrect comment about default retries (was 2, should be 3 per ADR-018)

## Backward Compatibility

To maintain compatibility with existing code:

- Exported legacy AI config objects that map to the new structure
- Used getters in legacy exports to maintain lazy evaluation where it existed
- All existing imports continue to work without modification

## Files Modified

- `packages/shared/src/config/index.ts` - Main refactoring
- `packages/shared/src/config/ai-analysis.ts` - Removed (consolidated)
- `packages/shared/src/index.ts` - Updated import
- `packages/shared/src/prompts/analysis/index.ts` - Updated import
- `packages/shared/src/prompts/truncation.ts` - Updated import

## Testing

- TypeScript compilation successful
- All type checks pass
- No breaking changes to public API
