# Request ID Middleware Grooming - January 20, 2025

## Summary
Consolidated duplicate request ID middleware from proxy and dashboard services into the shared package, improving code reuse and adding distributed tracing support.

## Changes Made

### 1. Identified Code Duplication
- Found identical `request-id.ts` files in both `services/proxy/src/middleware/` and `services/dashboard/src/middleware/`
- Both files contained the same implementation using nanoid for generating 12-character request IDs

### 2. Consolidated into Shared Package
- Created `packages/shared/src/middleware/request-id.ts` with enhanced implementation
- Added `packages/shared/src/middleware/index.ts` for clean exports
- Updated `packages/shared/src/index.ts` to export the middleware module

### 3. Enhanced Implementation
- Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation explaining purpose, format, and usage
- Introduced named constants for better maintainability:
  - `REQUEST_ID_ALPHABET`: Character set excluding ambiguous characters
  - `REQUEST_ID_LENGTH`: 12 characters
  - `REQUEST_ID_HEADER`: 'X-Request-ID'
- Added distributed tracing support by checking for existing request IDs
- Exported as const arrow function for better tree-shaking

### 4. Updated Service Imports
- Updated `services/proxy/src/app.ts` to import from `@claude-nexus/shared`
- Updated `services/dashboard/src/app.ts` to import from `@claude-nexus/shared`
- Removed duplicate files from both services

### 5. Dependency Management
- Added `nanoid` as a dependency to the shared package
- Added `hono` as a peer dependency (services already have it)

## Technical Decisions

### Why Check for Existing Request IDs?
Based on best practices for distributed systems, the middleware now checks for existing `X-Request-ID` headers. This enables:
- End-to-end request tracing across multiple services
- Better debugging in microservice architectures
- Integration with upstream services that may already generate request IDs

### Why Nanoid over UUID?
- Shorter IDs (12 vs 36 characters)
- URL-safe by default
- Better performance
- Sufficient entropy (~71 bits) for our use case

## Testing
- Verified TypeScript compilation passes
- Tested proxy service startup successfully
- Confirmed request ID generation works as expected

## Follow-up Actions
None required - the refactoring is complete and all services are functioning correctly.
