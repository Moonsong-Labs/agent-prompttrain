# Error Utilities Grooming - 2025-01-19

## Overview

Groomed the `packages/shared/src/utils/errors.ts` file to improve code quality, documentation, and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Comprehensive JSDoc Documentation

- Added detailed JSDoc comments for all functions and interfaces
- Included `@param`, `@returns`, and `@example` tags for better IDE support
- Documented the purpose and usage of each utility function

### 2. Replaced Magic Number with Named Constant

- Created `DEFAULT_ERROR_STATUS_CODE = 500` constant
- Replaced hardcoded `500` values with the named constant
- Makes the code more maintainable and self-documenting

### 3. Maintained Backward Compatibility

- Kept both `status` and `statusCode` properties in `HTTPResponseError` interface
- Added `@deprecated` JSDoc tag to `status` property to guide future migration
- This approach avoids breaking existing code while encouraging best practices

### 4. Improved Documentation for Interface

- Added clear documentation for the `HTTPResponseError` interface
- Marked `status` as deprecated with guidance to use `statusCode`
- Documented all properties with their purposes

## Rationale

### Why Not Remove `status` Property?

After analysis, the `status` property is used throughout the codebase via the `getStatusCode()` function. Removing it would be a breaking change that could impact production code. Instead, we:

- Deprecated it with clear documentation
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Set the stage for future removal when appropriate

### Why Add JSDoc?

- Improves developer experience with better IDE tooltips
- Provides usage examples directly in the code
- Makes the API self-documenting
- Reduces the need to read implementation details

### Why Named Constant?

- Makes the default status code explicit and searchable
- Allows for easy modification if needed
- Follows clean code principles by avoiding magic numbers

## Testing

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful (`bun run typecheck`)
- ✅ Shared package builds successfully (`bun run build`)
- ✅ Dashboard service (major consumer) type checks successfully
- ✅ No breaking changes introduced

## Future Considerations

1. **Add Unit Tests**: Consider adding comprehensive unit tests for these utilities
2. **Migration Path**: In a future major version, consider removing the deprecated `status` property
3. **Error Factory Functions**: Could add utility functions for creating common error types
4. **Async Error Handling**: Could add utilities for handling Promise rejections

## Impact

- **Low Risk**: Changes are backward compatible
- **High Value**: Improved developer experience and code maintainability
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing code continues to work as expected
