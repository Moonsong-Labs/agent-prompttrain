# Common Issues Documentation Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-01-21
**File:** `docs/05-Troubleshooting/common-issues.md`
**Branch:** file-grooming-07-18

## Summary

Refactored the common issues troubleshooting guide to improve clarity, organization, and completeness. The document now provides better navigation, more comprehensive coverage of common issues, and clearer solutions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Table of Contents

- Created comprehensive navigation structure
- Organized issues by category for easier discovery
- Added proper anchor links for all sections

### 2. Removed Duplicate Content

- Eliminated duplicate "Check Credential Files" section (lines 50-58)
- Consolidated credential checking instructions

### 3. Updated Content Structure

- Reorganized by issue frequency/severity as recommended by Gemini
- Grouped related issues under clear categories:
  - Authentication Errors
  - Request Errors
  - Database Issues
  - Service Issues
  - Token Usage

### 4. Added Missing Common Issues

- Request Timeout errors with configuration examples
- Rate Limiting (429) errors with monitoring solutions
- CORS issues with proper configuration steps
- Token limit exceeded errors with optimization tips

### 5. Improved Content Quality

- Added language identifiers to all code blocks (bash, json, sql, javascript, yaml)
- Replaced vague "Fixed in latest version" with actionable solutions
- Enhanced each solution with step-by-step instructions
- Added specific error message examples in JSON format

### 6. Enhanced Solutions

- Provided concrete command examples for each solution
- Added configuration file examples
- Included SQL queries for diagnostics
- Added Docker commands where relevant

### 7. Improved Documentation Links

- Added proper markdown links to related documentation
- Created Quick Reference section with common commands
- Added links to GitHub issues, debugging guide, and performance guide

### 8. Added Quick Reference Section

- Common troubleshooting commands
- Key environment variables for debugging
- Links to comprehensive documentation

## Rationale

These changes address several documentation quality issues:

1. **Better Navigation**: The table of contents makes it easy to find specific issues quickly
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Added missing common issues that users frequently encounter
3. **Actionable Solutions**: Each solution now provides clear, executable steps
4. **Maintainability**: Removed outdated "fixed in latest version" references that become stale
5. **Professional Format**: Consistent code block formatting with language identifiers
6. **User-Friendly**: Organized by frequency rather than arbitrary categories

## Testing

- Verified all markdown links are properly formatted
- Checked code block syntax highlighting
- Ensured table of contents links work correctly
- Validated all command examples for syntax

## Follow-up Recommendations

1. Consider adding a Mermaid flowchart for troubleshooting decision tree (deferred for now)
2. Create separate `advanced-troubleshooting.md` for complex scenarios
3. Add specific version numbers when issues are resolved in future updates
4. Monitor user feedback to identify additional common issues

## Impact

This refactoring significantly improves the user experience when troubleshooting issues. Users can now:

- Quickly find solutions to their specific problems
- Follow clear, step-by-step instructions
- Access related documentation easily
- Understand the root causes of issues better

The improved organization and comprehensive coverage should reduce support burden and improve user self-sufficiency.
