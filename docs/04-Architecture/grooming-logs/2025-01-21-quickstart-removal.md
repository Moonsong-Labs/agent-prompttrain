Date: 2025-01-21
File: `docs/00-Overview/quickstart.md`

## Summary

Removed redundant quickstart.md file that duplicated content from other documentation sources.

## Issues Found

1. Complete content duplication across 4 different files
2. Inconsistent commands and paths between versions
3. Maintenance burden of keeping multiple copies synchronized
4. User confusion about which guide to follow

## Changes Made

1. **Deleted** `docs/00-Overview/quickstart.md`
2. **Updated** all references to point to appropriate existing documentation:
   - `README.md` - points to installation and Docker deployment guides
   - `QUICKSTART.md` - converted to navigation guide
   - `client-setup/README.md` - references installation guide
   - `docs/README.md` - removed from overview section
   - `adr-034` - marked as removed with explanation

## Rationale

- Follows DRY principle for documentation
- Reduces maintenance burden
- Provides clearer user journey
- Existing guides are more comprehensive
