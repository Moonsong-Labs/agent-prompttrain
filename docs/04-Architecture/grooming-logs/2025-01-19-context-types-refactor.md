# Context Types Refactoring Log

**Date**: 2025-01-19
**File**: `packages/shared/src/types/context.ts`

## Summary

Refactored the Hono context type definitions to improve type safety, remove dead code, and enhance documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Dead Properties

- Removed `originalRequest` property - no usage found in codebase
- Removed `claudeResponse` property - no usage found in codebase

### 2. Improved Type Safety

- Replaced `credential?: any` with `MinimalCredential` interface
- Replaced `pool?: any` with `MinimalPool` interface
- Kept `validatedBody?: any` with comprehensive documentation

### 3. Added Minimal Type Interfaces

Created minimal interfaces to avoid circular dependencies while providing type hints:

- `MinimalCredential` - matches the shape of ClaudeCredentials
- `MinimalPool` - provides basic pg.Pool interface

### 4. Enhanced Documentation

- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments for both interfaces
- Documented each property's purpose and usage
- Added @example annotations showing typical usage patterns

### 5. Cleanup

- Deleted duplicate file at `/services/proxy/src/types/context.ts`

## Rationale

The refactoring follows these principles:

1. **Type Safety**: Replacing `any` types improves IDE support and catches errors at compile time
2. **No Circular Dependencies**: Using minimal interfaces keeps the shared package independent
3. **Dead Code Removal**: Removing unused properties reduces confusion and maintenance burden
4. **Better Documentation**: Clear documentation helps developers understand the context system

## Validation

- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Passes
- Build process: ✅ Successful
- Consensus validation: ✅ Approved by Gemini-2.5-pro (9/10 confidence)

## Impact

This is a low-risk, high-value refactoring that:

- Improves developer experience with better type hints
- Reduces technical debt
- Makes the codebase more maintainable
- Has no runtime impact (type-only changes)
