# QUICKSTART.md Content Restoration - Grooming Log

Date: 2025-01-21
File: `QUICKSTART.md`
Sprint: File Grooming (Production Readiness)

## Summary

Transformed QUICKSTART.md from a navigation-only file into a proper quick start guide with actionable Docker-based setup instructions.

## Analysis

1. **Current State**: Navigation-only file created after ADR-036 removed detailed quickstart content
2. **Best Practices**: Research showed quickstart files should contain actionable content
3. **User Impact**: Navigation-only approach creates friction for new users

## Changes Made

1. **Added 5-Minute Docker Setup**:
   - Prerequisites section
   - Step-by-step installation process
   - Verification commands
   - Maintained navigation links at bottom

2. **Content Structure**:
   - Focused on minimal, stable Docker commands
   - Removed unnecessary complexity
   - Added copy-paste ready code blocks

3. **Fixed Path Issue**:
   - Corrected API key generation script path to `scripts/auth/generate-api-key.ts`

## Rationale

- Improves new user onboarding experience
- Aligns with open source community expectations
- Provides immediate value without reading multiple documents
- Maintains links to detailed guides for advanced users

## Testing

- Verified all documentation links exist
- Confirmed docker-up.sh script is executable
- Validated script paths are correct
- Ensured commands follow project conventions

## Related Changes

- Created ADR-059 to document this architectural decision
- No changes to other documentation files required

## Impact

- **Positive**: Significantly improved new user experience
- **Maintenance**: Minor - only update if Docker setup fundamentally changes
- **Risk**: Low - commands are minimal and stable
