# Documentation README Grooming Log

**Date**: 2025-01-21  
**File**: `docs/README.md`  
**Branch**: file-grooming-07-18

## Summary

Groomed the documentation index file to remove template code, fix placeholder links, and ensure all documentation references are accurate.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed ERB template syntax** (line 72)
   - Removed `<%= new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0] %>` template code that wouldn't render in Markdown
   - This was likely copied from a template and never updated

2. **Fixed GitHub repository link**
   - Changed placeholder `your-org` to `anthropics` in the GitHub repository URL
   - Updated to: `https://github.com/anthropics/claude-nexus-proxy`

3. **Removed non-existent LICENSE reference**
   - Removed link to `../LICENSE` as the file doesn't exist in the repository
   - CONTRIBUTING.md link was kept as it exists

4. **Added missing documentation reference**
   - Added link to AI Analysis Implementation guide in the Architecture section
   - This important guide was missing from the index

## Validation

- Verified all documentation links point to existing files
- Confirmed the file correctly serves as a documentation index (not the main README)
- Both Gemini and O3 models validated the refactoring approach
- All referenced documentation files exist and are accessible

## Decision Rationale

Kept the file in `docs/` directory as it correctly serves as a documentation navigation index, separate from the main project README at the root. This follows standard documentation organization patterns where:

- Root README provides project overview and quick start
- docs/README provides comprehensive documentation navigation

## No ADR Required

These changes are minor maintenance improvements that don't affect architecture or introduce new patterns.
