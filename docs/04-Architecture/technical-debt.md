# Technical Debt Register

This document tracks known technical debt in the Claude Nexus Proxy project. Each item includes context, impact, and proposed remediation.

## High Priority

### 1. Memory Leak in StorageAdapter

**Location**: `services/proxy/src/storage/StorageAdapter.ts:12-15`

**Issue**: The `requestIdMap` grows indefinitely as requests are processed, causing memory usage to increase over time.

```typescript
// Current problematic code
private requestIdMap = new Map<string, string>();

// Missing cleanup after storeResponse
```

**Impact**:

- Service crashes after extended operation
- Increased memory costs
- Potential data loss during OOM crashes

**Remediation**:

```typescript
async storeResponse(data: ResponseData) {
  // ... existing code ...

  // Add cleanup
  this.requestIdMap.delete(data.request_id);
}

// Add periodic cleanup for orphaned entries
setInterval(() => {
  const oneHourAgo = Date.now() - 3600000;
  for (const [key, value] of this.requestIdMap.entries()) {
    if (value.timestamp < oneHourAgo) {
      this.requestIdMap.delete(key);
    }
  }
}, 300000); // Every 5 minutes
```

### 2. ✅ N+1 Query Pattern in Conversations API [RESOLVED]

**Location**: `services/proxy/src/routes/api.ts:456-460`

**Issue**: Correlated subqueries create an N+1 query pattern, causing poor performance with large datasets.

**Resolution** (2025-06-26):

- Replaced correlated subqueries with window functions using `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY conversation_id ORDER BY timestamp DESC, request_id DESC)`
- Added deterministic ordering with `request_id` as tie-breaker
- Created optimized indexes in migration `004-optimize-conversation-window-functions.ts`:
  - `idx_requests_conversation_timestamp_id` for efficient window function execution
  - `idx_requests_conversation_subtask` for subtask filtering
  - `idx_requests_request_id` for final LEFT JOIN
- Changed parent_task_request_id selection to use first subtask in conversation for consistency

**Performance Improvements**:

- Eliminated N+1 pattern by computing all fields in a single pass
- Reduced query complexity from O(n\*m) to O(n log n)
- Added proper indexes aligned with window function partitioning

## Medium Priority

### 3. ✅ N+1 Query in Token Usage Time Series [RESOLVED]

**Location**: `services/proxy/src/routes/api.ts:771-774`

**Issue**: Was looping through each account and executing separate queries for time series data.

**Resolution Date**: 2025-06-26

**Fix Applied**:

- Refactored to fetch all time series data in a single query
- Used UNNEST with array parameter to process all accounts at once
- Employed FILTER clause for conditional aggregation
- Grouped results by account using Map for efficient lookup

**Performance Improvement**:

- Reduced database queries from N+1 to 1 (where N = number of accounts)
- Significantly improved dashboard loading time for multiple accounts

### 4. ✅ Dashboard Overview Performance [RESOLVED]

**Location**: `services/dashboard/src/routes/overview.ts`

**Issue**: Dashboard overview page was fetching up to 10,000 conversations at once and processing them client-side, causing severe performance issues with large databases (40+ GB).

**Resolution Date**: 2025-08-11

**Fix Applied**:

- Created new `/api/dashboard/stats` endpoint for aggregated statistics using CTEs
- Added server-side pagination to `/api/conversations` endpoint (offset, limit, date filters)
- Reduced default fetch from 10,000 to 50 conversations
- Dashboard now fetches stats and conversations in parallel
- All aggregation moved to server-side using optimized SQL queries

**Performance Improvement**:

- Data transfer reduced by 99.5% (50 vs 10,000 records)
- Dashboard load time reduced from >10s to <2s target
- Memory usage significantly reduced (no large arrays in browser)
- Server performs aggregation in single optimized query

**Implementation Details**:

- Stats endpoint uses CTEs for efficient aggregation
- Pagination metadata included in API responses
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing API consumers
- Proper use of existing database indexes

### 5. Missing Automated Tests

**Location**: Project-wide

**Issue**: ~~No automated test suite despite complex business logic.~~ **Partially Addressed**

**Status Update**: E2E tests have been implemented with Playwright (see ADR-021, PR #110). Unit and integration tests still pending.

**Impact**:

- ~~Risk of regressions~~ **Reduced** (E2E tests catch UI/workflow regressions)
- Slower development velocity (unit tests still needed)
- ~~Lower confidence in changes~~ **Improved** (E2E tests provide safety net)

**Remaining Work**:

1. Add unit tests for critical functions:
   - Message hashing
   - Token counting
   - Authentication logic
2. Add integration tests for API endpoints
3. ~~Add end-to-end tests for critical user journeys~~ ✅ **Completed**
4. ~~Set up CI/CD pipeline with test requirements~~ ✅ **Completed for E2E**

### 5. Configuration Hardcoding

**Location**: Various files

**Issue**: Some configuration values are hardcoded rather than externalized.

**Impact**:

- Requires code changes for configuration updates
- Risk of exposing sensitive values

**Remediation**:

- Audit all hardcoded values
- Move to environment variables or config files
- Document all configuration options

## Low Priority

### 6. Incomplete Error Handling

**Location**: Various async functions

**Issue**: Some async operations lack proper error handling and recovery.

**Impact**:

- Ungraceful failures
- Poor error messages for debugging

**Remediation**:

- Add try-catch blocks to all async operations
- Implement proper error logging
- Add error recovery mechanisms

### 7. ✅ Database Migration Strategy [RESOLVED]

**Location**: `scripts/db/migrations/`

**Issue**: Manual migration execution without version tracking.

**Resolution Date**: 2025-06-26

**Fix Applied**:

- Standardized on TypeScript migration scripts with numeric ordering
- Created comprehensive `init-database.sql` for fresh installations
- Updated `writer.ts` to use init SQL file instead of inline table creation
- Documented migration patterns and best practices
- All migrations are idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

**Improvements**:

- Consistent schema management approach
- Clear migration ordering with numeric prefixes
- TypeScript provides type safety and better tooling
- See ADR-012 for detailed architecture decision

**Future Enhancements** (Nice to have):

- Migration version tracking table
- Automated migration runner
- Rollback capability

### 8. API Response Caching

**Location**: API routes

**Issue**: No caching for expensive queries.

**Impact**:

- Repeated expensive computations
- Higher latency for common requests

**Remediation**:

- Implement Redis caching layer
- Add cache invalidation logic
- Configure TTLs appropriately

## Tracking and Resolution

### Process

1. **Identification**: Document new debt as it's introduced
2. **Prioritization**: Assess impact and effort quarterly
3. **Resolution**: Allocate 20% of development time to debt reduction
4. **Prevention**: Review PRs for new debt introduction

### Metrics

Track technical debt health:

- Number of high-priority items
