# ADR-042: ADR-001 Monorepo Structure Documentation Update

## Status

Accepted

## Context

During the file grooming sprint (2025-01-21), ADR-001 (Monorepo Structure) was identified as needing updates. The ADR contained outdated implementation details and was missing cross-references to related architectural decisions that have evolved since the original decision.

## Decision Drivers

- **Accuracy**: Documentation should reflect the current implementation state
- **Traceability**: Related ADRs should be cross-referenced for better navigation
- **Historical Context**: Evolution of decisions should be documented
- **Best Practices**: ADRs should follow current documentation standards

## Decision

Update ADR-001 to:

1. Replace outdated package.json examples with current implementation details
2. Add cross-references to ADR-013 (TypeScript Project References)
3. Update consequences section to reflect lessons learned
4. Add metadata tracking (last updated date)
5. Document the evolution of the implementation

## Implementation

The following changes were made to ADR-001:

### Updated Implementation Details

- Removed the outdated package.json example
- Added bullet points describing the actual implementation:
  - Workspace configuration
  - Shared package structure
  - Build order management via TypeScript Project References
  - Development scripts
  - Type safety approach

### Enhanced Consequences Section

- Added positive consequence: "Consistent Standards" across packages
- Updated negative consequences to reference mitigations:
  - Build order dependencies mitigated by TypeScript Project References
  - Added note about TypeScript compilation challenges being resolved

### Cross-References

- Added link to ADR-013 in the Links section
- Added inline references to ADR-013 where relevant

### Metadata Updates

- Kept original date (2024-01-15) for historical accuracy
- Added "Last Updated: 2025-01-21"
- Maintained original authors

### Evolution Note

- Added note documenting the successful implementation of TypeScript Project References

## Consequences

### Positive

- ADR-001 now accurately reflects the current implementation
- Developers can better understand the evolution of the monorepo structure
- Cross-references improve navigation between related decisions
- Historical context is preserved while showing current state

### Negative

- None identified
