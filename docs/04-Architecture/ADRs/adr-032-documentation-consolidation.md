# ADR-032: Documentation Consolidation - Removing Redundant Setup Files

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-01-21

**Deciders**: Crystalin, Gemini 2.5 Pro, O3 Mini

## Context

During the file grooming process, we identified `AI-ANALYSIS-SETUP.md` at the root level of the project. This file:

1. **Duplicated content** already present in:
   - `CLAUDE.md` (the primary reference for Claude Code, includes AI worker configuration)
   - `docs/04-Architecture/ai-analysis-implementation-guide.md` (detailed implementation info)

2. **Violated project structure conventions** by being at the root level instead of in the documentation hierarchy

3. **Created maintenance burden** with multiple sources of truth that could diverge over time

4. **Contained outdated references** (PR #80)

## Decision

We have decided to **delete** `AI-ANALYSIS-SETUP.md` to maintain a single source of truth for documentation.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Single Source of Truth**: All AI analysis setup information is now centralized in CLAUDE.md and the architecture documentation
- **Reduced Maintenance**: No need to keep multiple files synchronized
- **Cleaner Repository**: Root level remains focused on essential files only
- **Prevents Confusion**: Engineers won't be confused by potentially conflicting documentation

### Negative

- None identified. The file provided no unique value and all content was already available elsewhere.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Move and Refactor**: Move the file to `docs/03-Operations/setup/` and refactor it to reference other documentation
   - Rejected because it would still create an additional file to maintain for no clear benefit

2. **Keep As-Is**: Leave the file at the root level
   - Rejected as it violates best practices for production codebases

## Implementation

1. Verified all content exists in other documentation
2. Checked for any references to the file (none found)
3. Deleted the file using `git rm`
4. Created this ADR to document the decision
