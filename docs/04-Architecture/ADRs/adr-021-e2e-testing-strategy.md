# ADR-021: End-to-End Testing Strategy with Playwright

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Claude Nexus Proxy project has been operating without comprehensive automated testing, which was identified as technical debt in ADR-011. As the application grows in complexity with features like conversation tracking, sub-task detection, and AI-powered analysis, the need for automated testing becomes critical to maintain quality and prevent regressions.

The dashboard service, built with HTMX (ADR-009), presents unique testing challenges:

- Server-side rendering with HTML-over-the-wire updates
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time data
- Complex user interactions across multiple pages
- Authentication requirements with API keys

## Decision

We will implement end-to-end testing using Playwright with the following architecture:

### Framework Choice: Playwright

- **Cross-browser support**: Test on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Built-in waiting mechanisms**: Handles dynamic content and network requests
- **Powerful debugging**: Trace viewer, screenshots, and video recording
- **TypeScript support**: Consistent with project's language choice
- **Authentication helpers**: StorageState for session persistence

### Test Architecture

1. **Simplified Page Object Model**
   - Use simple helper functions over complex class hierarchies
   - Focus on data-testid selectors for stability
   - Avoid over-abstraction to maintain readability

2. **Test Organization**
   - `e2e/smoke-tests/`: Quick validation of all pages (rendering, console errors)
   - `e2e/journeys/`: Critical user workflows (viewing requests, analyzing conversations)
   - `e2e/utils/`: Shared utilities (auth, console monitoring)

3. **Console Error Monitoring**
   - Custom ConsoleMonitor utility to catch JavaScript errors
   - Filtering patterns for third-party noise (analytics, extensions)
   - Automatic failure on unexpected console errors

4. **Authentication Strategy**
   - Use Playwright's storageState for session persistence
   - Set API key headers at BrowserContext level
   - Single auth setup shared across tests

### CI/CD Integration

Building on the existing GitHub Actions infrastructure (ADR-008):

1. **PR Workflow** (Quick Feedback)
   - Run smoke tests only (@smoke tag)
   - Single browser (Chromium)
   - ~2 minute execution time

2. **Nightly Workflow** (Comprehensive)
   - All tests including journeys
   - Full browser matrix
   - Performance budget validation

3. **Test Execution Strategy**
   - Serial execution for auth-dependent tests (avoid race conditions)
   - Parallel execution for independent test files
   - Fail-fast on CI to save resources

### Test Data Management

- Use existing database for test isolation
- No mocking of backend services (true e2e)
- Leverage Docker Compose for consistent environments (ADR-002)

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Quality Assurance**: Automated detection of regressions before deployment
- **Developer Confidence**: Safe refactoring with immediate feedback
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of user workflows
- **CI/CD Integration**: Seamless integration with existing GitHub Actions
- **Cross-browser Coverage**: Ensure compatibility across major browsers
- **Performance Monitoring**: Catch performance regressions early

### Negative

- **Maintenance Overhead**: Tests require updates when UI changes
- **Execution Time**: Full test suite takes 5-10 minutes
- **Flakiness Risk**: Network and timing issues can cause intermittent failures
- **Resource Usage**: Browser automation requires significant CI resources

### Neutral

- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Playwright APIs and best practices
- **Test Data**: Requires careful management to avoid test interdependencies

## Implementation Notes

### Key Files Created

- `e2e/playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration
- `e2e/utils/console-monitor.ts` - Console error detection
- `e2e/utils/auth-helper.ts` - Authentication setup
- `e2e/smoke-tests/all-pages.spec.ts` - Smoke test coverage
- `e2e/journeys/critical-journeys.spec.ts` - User journey tests
- `.github/workflows/e2e-nightly.yml` - Nightly test workflow

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers
bunx playwright install --with-deps chromium

# Run all tests
bun run test:e2e

# Run smoke tests only
bun run test:e2e:smoke

# Run with UI mode for debugging
bunx playwright test --ui
```

### Performance Budgets

- Page load: < 2 seconds (CI: < 3 seconds)
- First interaction: < 1 second
- Navigation: < 500ms
