# ADR-011: Future Architectural Decisions

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Based on the technical debt register and evolving requirements, several architectural decisions need to be made in the near future. This ADR documents pending decisions that require formal documentation once implementation approaches are determined.

## Pending Decisions

### 1. Database Partitioning Strategy

**Context**: The api_requests table will grow large over time, affecting query performance.

**Options to Consider**:
- Monthly partitioning by created_at
- Partitioning by account_id for better account isolation
- Hybrid partitioning (time + account)
- Archive to cold storage after X days

**Decision Needed By**: When table exceeds 10M rows

### 2. Caching Architecture

**Context**: No caching layer exists, causing repeated expensive computations.

**Options to Consider**:
- Redis for distributed caching
- In-memory caching with cache invalidation
- Edge caching with CDN
- Database materialized views

**Decision Needed By**: When dashboard response times exceed 1s

### 3. Rate Limiting Implementation

**Context**: Currently relies entirely on Claude API rate limiting.

**Options to Consider**:
- Token bucket algorithm per account
- Sliding window counters
- Distributed rate limiting with Redis
- API Gateway integration

**Decision Needed By**: When proxy-level rate limiting becomes necessary

### 4. Testing Strategy

**Context**: No automated tests exist despite complex business logic.

**Options to Consider**:
- Test framework selection (Bun test, Jest, Vitest)
- Test types prioritization (unit, integration, e2e)
- Test data management strategy
- CI/CD test integration

**Decision Needed By**: Before next major feature

### 5. Observability Platform

**Context**: Limited observability beyond basic logging and metrics.

**Options to Consider**:
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Datadog/New Relic/etc.
- Self-hosted (Prometheus + Grafana + Jaeger)
- Cloud-native solutions

**Decision Needed By**: Production deployment

### 6. Multi-Region Deployment

**Context**: Single region deployment limits availability and latency.

**Options to Consider**:
- Active-active multi-region
- Active-passive with failover
- Edge proxy deployment
- Database replication strategy

**Decision Needed By**: When SLA requirements demand HA

### 7. Secret Management

**Context**: Credentials stored in plain files.

**Options to Consider**:
- HashiCorp Vault
- AWS Secrets Manager / Azure Key Vault
- Kubernetes secrets
- Encrypted file storage with key rotation

**Decision Needed By**: Production deployment

### 8. API Versioning

**Context**: No versioning strategy for proxy API changes.

**Options to Consider**:
- URL versioning (/v1/, /v2/)
- Header versioning
- Content negotiation
- GraphQL migration

**Decision Needed By**: First breaking API change

### 9. Event Sourcing

**Context**: State changes not captured as events.

**Options to Consider**:
- Full event sourcing
- Audit log only
- Change data capture (CDC)
- Hybrid approach

**Decision Needed By**: When audit requirements emerge

### 10. Horizontal Scaling

**Context**: Single instance deployment.

**Options to Consider**:
- Kubernetes deployment
- Container orchestration
- Load balancer configuration
- Session affinity requirements

**Decision Needed By**: When single instance capacity reached

## Process for Future ADRs

1. **Trigger**: Technical debt item becomes critical OR new requirement emerges
2. **Research**: Evaluate options with POCs if needed
3. **Document**: Create ADR following template
4. **Review**: Architecture review with stakeholders
5. **Implement**: Execute decision with monitoring
