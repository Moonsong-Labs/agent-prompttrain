# ADR-023: Conversation Hash Refactoring

Date: 2025-01-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The `conversation-hash.ts` file in the shared package contained several code quality issues that needed to be addressed:

1. **Dead code references**: Comments referencing non-existent test utility files
2. **Complex functions**: The `normalizeMessageContent` function was 76 lines with deeply nested logic
3. **Magic strings**: Repeated string literals without constants
4. **Undocumented regex patterns**: Complex regex patterns without clear documentation
5. **Anti-patterns**: Creating mock logger instances just to use ConversationLinker
6. **Missing documentation**: Some functions lacked proper JSDoc comments

## Decision

We refactored the `conversation-hash.ts` file with the following improvements:

### 1. Removed Dead Code References

- Removed comments referencing non-existent `test-utilities/conversation-hash-test-utils.ts`
- Cleaned up obsolete function migration notes

### 2. Extracted Constants

- Created `CLI_TOOL_PREFIX` constant for the frequently used CLI tool identification string
- Created `REGEX_PATTERNS` object to document all regex patterns used for system prompt normalization

### 3. Decomposed Complex Functions

- Split `normalizeMessageContent` into smaller, focused functions:
  - `filterSystemReminders`: Filters out system reminder content
  - `deduplicateToolItems`: Removes duplicate tool use/result items
  - `normalizeContentItem`: Normalizes individual content items
  - Main function now orchestrates these smaller functions

### 4. Improved Documentation

- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to all exported functions
- Documented the purpose and behavior of each regex pattern
- Clarified the relationship with ConversationLinker

### 5. Maintained Compatibility

- No changes to function signatures or behavior
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Type checking remains clean

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Improved readability**: Smaller, focused functions are easier to understand
- **Better maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes changes easier
- **Enhanced documentation**: Future developers can understand the code's purpose better
- **Consistent patterns**: Using constants reduces the chance of typos and inconsistencies

### Negative

- **Slightly more code**: Breaking down functions adds some overhead
- **ESLint warnings**: Using `any` type for flexible content structures generates warnings (but these are appropriate in this context)

### Neutral

- The mock logger pattern in `hashMessagesOnly` remains as it would require changes to ConversationLinker's API to fix properly
- The file remains in its current location as it's appropriately placed in the shared utilities

## Implementation Details

The refactoring maintained all existing functionality while improving code quality. Key changes:

1. **Constants extraction**:

   ```typescript
   const CLI_TOOL_PREFIX =
     'You are an interactive CLI tool that helps users with software engineering tasks'
   ```

2. **Regex pattern documentation**:

   ```typescript
   const REGEX_PATTERNS = {
     TRANSIENT_CONTEXT: /<transient_context>[\s\S]*?<\/transient_context>/g,
     GIT_STATUS: /gitStatus:[\s\S]*?(?:\n\n|$)/g,
     // ... other patterns with clear comments
   }
   ```

3. **Function decomposition**: The 76-line function was split into 4 smaller functions, each with a single responsibility

All changes were validated through:

- Running existing test suite (33 tests, all passing)
- Type checking with TypeScript
- ESLint validation (warnings only, no errors)
