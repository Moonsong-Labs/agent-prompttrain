# ADR-020: Documentation Accuracy Standards

## Status

Accepted

## Context

During code grooming, we discovered that `docs/03-Operations/ai-analysis-security.md` documented extensive security features as if they were implemented, when most were actually planned future features. This created:

- **Misleading information** for developers and stakeholders
- **False security assurances** about the system's capabilities
- **Documentation debt** that could compound over time
- **Risk of incorrect assumptions** during development or security audits

## Decision

We will enforce strict documentation accuracy standards:

1. **Clear Status Indicators**: All features must be clearly marked as:
   - ✅ Implemented and available
   - 🚧 In progress
   - 📋 Planned/Future
   - ❌ Deprecated/Removed

2. **Separation of Current vs Future**: Documents must clearly separate:
   - "Current Implementation" sections
   - "Planned Features" or "Future Roadmap" sections

3. **No Aspirational Documentation**: Features must not be documented as if they exist when they don't

4. **Regular Audits**: Documentation should be reviewed when features are implemented to ensure accuracy

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Trust**: Developers can trust documentation to reflect reality
- **Clarity**: Clear understanding of what's available vs planned
- **Risk Reduction**: No false security assumptions
- **Better Planning**: Clear roadmap visibility

### Negative

- **Initial Effort**: Requires auditing existing documentation
- **Maintenance**: Requires updating docs when features ship

### Neutral

- **Cultural Shift**: Moves from aspirational to factual documentation

## Implementation

1. Refactored `ai-analysis-security.md` to clearly show implemented vs planned features
2. Used visual indicators (✅, 🔜, 📋) for quick status recognition
3. Reorganized content with clear section headers
4. Added explicit notes where configuration exists but isn't utilized
