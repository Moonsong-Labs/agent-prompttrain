# ADR-048: ADR-013 TypeScript Project References Documentation Grooming

## Status

Accepted and Implemented

## Context

During the file grooming sprint, ADR-013 (TypeScript Project References) was identified as needing documentation improvements. The document had several issues:

- A broken GitHub issue link that didn't exist
- An incorrect future date (2025-06-26 when created on 2025-06-27)
- Incomplete code examples that didn't match actual implementation
- Redundant information between sections
- Missing clarity about implementation status

## Decision

Groom ADR-013 to fix documentation issues while preserving its architectural content and historical record. Following ADR best practices, add an "Amendments" section to track changes rather than silently modifying content.

## Implementation

### Changes Made:

1. **Fixed broken link**: Removed non-existent GitHub issue reference
2. **Corrected date**: Updated to actual creation date (2025-06-27)
3. **Enhanced code examples**: Made them match actual implementation with complete configurations
4. **Consolidated redundancy**: Moved "Initial Setup Note" into implementation section
5. **Clarified status**: Changed from "Accepted" to "Accepted and Implemented"
6. **Added cross-reference**: Linked to ADR-026 (TypeScript Base Configuration)
7. **Added Amendments section**: Documented grooming changes for historical transparency

### Key Principle

Per Gemini's recommendation: ADRs should be treated as historical records, but when they document active patterns, they must remain useful. The Amendments section preserves the historical context while ensuring accuracy.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Developers get accurate, complete documentation
- Code examples now match actual implementation
- Historical integrity preserved through Amendments section
- Sets precedent for future ADR maintenance

### Negative

- None identified
