# ADR-053: Performance Documentation Refactoring

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The performance.md troubleshooting documentation contained several critical inaccuracies and outdated information:

1. **Incorrect SQL queries**: Referenced non-existent `response_time_ms` column instead of actual `duration_ms` and `first_token_ms` columns
2. **Wrong runtime context**: Referenced Node.js debugging tools despite the project using Bun exclusively
3. **Outdated solutions**: Included memory leak fixes that were already implemented in StorageAdapter
4. **Missing features**: Referenced Redis caching and nginx load balancing which don't exist in the codebase
5. **Poor organization**: Lacked quick diagnosis checklist and prevention strategies

## Decision

Refactored the performance documentation to:

1. Fix all SQL queries to use correct column names from the actual database schema
2. Replace Node.js references with Bun-appropriate commands and debugging approaches
3. Remove outdated memory leak solutions and reference the implemented environment variables
4. Remove non-existent features and focus on actual implementation
5. Add quick diagnosis checklist at the beginning for rapid troubleshooting
6. Include prevention strategies section for proactive performance management
7. Add proper cross-references to related documentation and ADRs

## Consequences

### Positive

- Documentation now accurately reflects the actual implementation
- Developers can successfully run the provided SQL queries
- Clear quick diagnosis checklist improves troubleshooting speed
- Prevention strategies help avoid performance issues proactively
- Proper cross-references provide context and deeper understanding

### Negative

- None identified

### Neutral

- Removed theoretical optimizations (Redis, nginx) that could be future considerations
- Documentation is now more tightly coupled to current implementation

## Implementation Notes

- Verified all SQL column names against init-database.sql schema
- Confirmed environment variable names from actual codebase constants
- Added references to dashboard features and API endpoints
- Included links to relevant ADRs for architectural context
