# ADR-008: CI/CD Strategy with GitHub Actions

## Status

Superseded by [ADR-032: CI/CD Workflow Consolidation and Optimization](adr-032-cicd-workflow-consolidation.md)

> **Note**: This ADR documents the original CI/CD strategy from June 2024. It has been superseded by ADR-032 in January 2025, which consolidated and optimized the workflow. Please refer to ADR-032 for the current implementation.

## Context

As a monorepo with multiple services (proxy, dashboard) and shared packages, we needed a continuous integration and deployment strategy that could:

- Build and test all components
- Handle TypeScript compilation across workspaces
- Build Docker images for deployment
- Support both development and production workflows
- Provide fast feedback on pull requests

The choice of CI/CD platform and strategy would significantly impact developer productivity and deployment reliability.

## Decision Drivers

- **Monorepo Support**: Handle Bun workspaces effectively
- **Speed**: Fast feedback on commits and PRs
- **Cost**: Minimize CI/CD expenses
- **Integration**: Native integration with GitHub
- **Flexibility**: Support various deployment targets
- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and maintain

## Considered Options

1. **GitHub Actions**
   - Description: GitHub's native CI/CD platform
   - Pros: Native integration, free for public repos, good marketplace
   - Cons: Limited free minutes for private repos

2. **GitLab CI**
   - Description: GitLab's integrated CI/CD
   - Pros: Powerful, self-hostable, great for monorepos
   - Cons: Requires GitLab, learning curve

3. **CircleCI**
   - Description: Cloud-based CI/CD service
   - Pros: Fast, good caching, Docker support
   - Cons: Cost, separate service to manage

4. **Jenkins**
   - Description: Self-hosted CI/CD
   - Pros: Fully customizable, free
   - Cons: Maintenance overhead, hosting costs

## Decision

We will use **GitHub Actions** for all CI/CD workflows.

### Original Implementation Approach

The original implementation used GitHub Actions with:

- Separate jobs for TypeScript checking and building
- Matrix builds for multiple services (proxy, dashboard)
- Docker BuildKit for image creation
- Caching strategies for dependencies and build artifacts
- Continue-on-error for TypeScript checks during PR reviews

_Note: For current implementation details, see [ADR-032](adr-032-cicd-workflow-consolidation.md)._

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Native GitHub Integration**: Seamless PR checks and status
- **Cost Effective**: Free for public repositories
- **Good Ecosystem**: Extensive marketplace of actions
- **Easy Secrets Management**: Built-in secrets handling
- **Matrix Builds**: Parallel builds for multiple services
- **Self-Documenting**: Workflows are code in the repository

### Negative

- **Vendor Lock-in**: Tied to GitHub platform
- **Limited Free Minutes**: Constraints on private repos
- **YAML Complexity**: Complex workflows become hard to read
- **Debugging Challenges**: Limited SSH access for debugging

### Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: GitHub Actions outages affect deployments
  - **Mitigation**: Document manual deployment procedures
  - **Mitigation**: Consider backup CI/CD for critical situations

- **Risk**: Secrets exposure in logs
  - **Mitigation**: Use masked secrets
  - **Mitigation**: Careful log output review

## Historical Implementation Notes

This ADR documented the initial CI/CD approach:

- Used official Bun setup action
- Separate workflows for CI and deployment
- TypeScript errors didn't block PR reviews (continue-on-error)
- Docker builds used BuildKit for better caching

**Superseded**: See [ADR-032](adr-032-cicd-workflow-consolidation.md) for how these workflows were consolidated and optimized in January 2025.

## Workflow Patterns

1. **PR Validation**:
   - TypeScript checking
   - Build verification
   - Future: automated tests

2. **Main Branch Protection**:
   - Require PR reviews
   - Require CI passing
   - No direct pushes

3. **Release Process**:
   - Tag triggers release workflow
   - Builds production Docker images
   - Pushes to registry

## Future Enhancements

1. **Test Integration**: Add test runs when tests exist
2. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark PRs against main
3. **Security Scanning**: Container and dependency scanning
4. **Deployment Automation**: Auto-deploy to staging
5. **Release Notes**: Automated changelog generation
