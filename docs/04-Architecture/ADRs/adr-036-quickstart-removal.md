# ADR-036: Quick Start Guide Removal

Date: 2025-01-21
Status: Accepted
Author: Claude (AI Assistant)

## Context

The `docs/00-Overview/quickstart.md` file provided Docker-based quick setup instructions for the Claude Nexus Proxy. However, analysis revealed several issues:

1. **Complete Duplication**: The same information existed in multiple locations:
   - `README.md` (Quick Start section)
   - `docs/01-Getting-Started/installation.md` (comprehensive guide including Docker)
   - `docs/03-Operations/deployment/docker-compose.md` (detailed Docker deployment)

2. **Inconsistencies**: Commands and paths differed between the various versions, creating potential confusion

3. **Maintenance Burden**: Keeping four copies of similar content synchronized was inefficient and error-prone

4. **User Confusion**: Multiple entry points for the same information made it unclear which guide to follow

## Decision

Remove `docs/00-Overview/quickstart.md` entirely and update all references to point to the appropriate existing documentation.

## Rationale

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Aligns with the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle for documentation
2. **Reduced Maintenance**: Eliminates the need to keep multiple copies synchronized
3. **Clearer User Journey**: Users have a single, authoritative source for each type of setup
4. **Better Organization**: The existing guides are more comprehensive and better maintained

## Consequences

### Positive

- Simplified documentation structure
- Reduced chance of outdated or conflicting information
- Lower maintenance burden for contributors
- Clearer path for new users

### Negative

- Existing external links to quickstart.md will break (mitigated by root QUICKSTART.md redirect)
- Users familiar with the old structure may need to adjust

## Implementation

1. Deleted `docs/00-Overview/quickstart.md`
2. Updated references in:
   - `README.md` - now points to installation and Docker deployment guides
   - `QUICKSTART.md` - converted to navigation guide pointing to appropriate resources
   - `client-setup/README.md` - updated to reference installation guide
   - `docs/README.md` - removed quickstart from overview section
   - `docs/04-Architecture/ADRs/adr-034-installation-guide-refactoring.md` - marked quickstart as removed

3. Verified all target documentation files exist and links are valid
