# ADR-055: Security Documentation Refactoring

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The security.md documentation file had become outdated and inconsistent with the current implementation:

- Referenced incorrect commands (`bun run auth:generate-key` instead of `scripts/generate-api-key.ts`)
- Showed JSON examples with comments (JSON doesn't support comments)
- Generic SQL examples that didn't match actual database schema
- Missing references to important security features (MCP server, AI analysis)
- No cross-references to related documentation

## Decision

Refactored the security.md file to:

1. Update all commands and examples to match current implementation
2. Add missing sections for MCP server security and AI analysis security
3. Improve cross-references to related ADRs and documentation
4. Fix JSON examples (remove comments)
5. Update SQL examples to use actual table/column names
6. Add environment variable security best practices
7. Add threat model section
8. Add dependency vulnerability management with `bun audit`
9. Keep security.md focused on operational security while linking to ai-analysis-security.md

## Consequences

### Positive

- Accurate documentation reduces misconfiguration risks
- Clear separation between operational and application-level security
- Better cross-references help users find related information
- Threat model provides clear security overview
- Dependency management section promotes security hygiene

### Negative

- None identified

## Implementation Notes

Following Gemini's recommendation (9/10 confidence), kept security.md and ai-analysis-security.md as separate files:

- security.md: Operational security for deploying and managing the proxy
- ai-analysis-security.md: Application-level security for AI features
