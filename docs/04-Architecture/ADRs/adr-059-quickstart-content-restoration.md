# ADR-059: Quick Start Content Restoration

Date: 2025-01-21
Status: Accepted
Author: Claude (AI Assistant)

## Context

ADR-036 documented the removal of `docs/00-Overview/quickstart.md` to eliminate content duplication and maintenance burden. The root `QUICKSTART.md` was converted to a navigation-only file pointing to other documentation.

However, this approach contradicts established best practices for quickstart documentation:

1. **Industry Standards**: Modern open source projects expect QUICKSTART files to contain actionable content
2. **User Experience**: Navigation-only quickstart files create friction for new users
3. **Community Feedback**: Best practices research indicates quickstart files should provide the fastest path to a working installation

## Decision

Transform the root `QUICKSTART.md` from a navigation-only file into a proper quick start guide containing:

1. Minimal Docker-based setup instructions (5-minute setup)
2. Essential prerequisites only
3. Copy-paste ready commands
4. Simple verification steps
5. Links to detailed documentation at the bottom

## Rationale

1. **User-First Approach**: New users expect immediate, actionable steps in a quickstart file
2. **No True Duplication**: The quickstart provides a curated, minimal path while detailed guides explain the "how and why"
3. **Different Audiences**: Quickstart serves impatient experts; detailed guides serve users needing customization
4. **Maintenance Strategy**: Keep quickstart commands stable and minimal to reduce update frequency

## Implementation

The new QUICKSTART.md structure:

```markdown
# Quick Start (5-Minute Docker Setup)

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Claude API key

## 1. Clone and Configure

[Simple clone and .env setup]

## 2. Set Essential Variables

[Minimal required configuration]

## 3. Create Domain Credentials

[Quick credential setup]

## 4. Start Services

[Docker commands]

## 5. Verify Installation

[Test command and dashboard access]

## Next Steps

[Links to detailed documentation]
```

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved new user onboarding experience
- Aligns with open source community expectations
- Maintains separation between quick setup and detailed documentation
- Provides clear value proposition (5-minute setup)

### Negative

- Minor maintenance burden when Docker setup changes
- Slight deviation from strict DRY principle
- Requires keeping quickstart commands synchronized

### Mitigation

- Keep quickstart instructions minimal and stable
- Focus only on Docker path (most stable deployment method)
- Regular grooming to ensure accuracy
