# Shared Package TSConfig Improvements

**Date:** 2025-01-19  
**File:** `packages/shared/tsconfig.json`  
**Sprint:** File Grooming

## Summary

Improved the TypeScript configuration file for the shared package to align with project standards and modern best practices.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added JSON Schema Reference

- Added `$schema` property for better IDE support and validation
- Provides intellisense and error checking in editors

### 2. Added Documentation Comments

- Added comprehensive comments explaining the file's purpose
- Documented why specific overrides are needed
- Grouped related configuration options with descriptive comments

### 3. Removed Redundant Configuration

- Removed `emitDeclarationOnly: false` as it's redundant when `noEmit` is already false
- This simplifies the configuration without changing behavior

### 4. Added Modern Module Resolution

- Added `moduleResolution: "bundler"` for better compatibility with Bun and modern bundlers
- This is the recommended setting for projects using bundlers rather than Node.js runtime

### 5. Documented Type Dependencies Conflict

- Added comment explaining why both `node` and `bun-types` are needed despite conflicts
- Notes that `skipLibCheck: true` in base config handles the type conflicts

## Rationale

1. **Consistency**: Aligns with other tsconfig files in the project that have schema and documentation
2. **Maintainability**: Clear comments help future developers understand configuration choices
3. **Modern Standards**: Using `bundler` module resolution is appropriate for a Bun-based project
4. **Simplification**: Removing redundant settings reduces cognitive load

## Testing

- Verified type checking passes: `bun run typecheck`
- Verified package builds successfully: `cd packages/shared && bun run build`
- Confirmed dist output is generated correctly with declaration files

## Impact

No functional changes - only improvements to configuration clarity and maintainability.
