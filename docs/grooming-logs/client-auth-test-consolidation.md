# Client Authentication Test Consolidation

## Date: 2025-01-20

## File: services/proxy/tests/client-auth-enhanced.test.ts

### Summary

Consolidated duplicate client authentication tests into the main test file to improve test organization and eliminate duplication.

### Changes Made

1. **Deleted**: `services/proxy/tests/client-auth-enhanced.test.ts`
   - This file was in the wrong location (tests/ directory instead of colocated with code)
   - Duplicated MockAuthenticationService implementation
   - Created confusion about where tests should live

2. **Enhanced**: `services/proxy/src/middleware/__tests__/client-auth.test.ts`
   - Added domain case sensitivity tests
   - Added comprehensive edge case tests (empty keys, long keys, special characters)
   - Added security header spoofing tests (X-Forwarded-Host, X-Original-Host)
   - Added internationalized domain name tests (Punycode)
   - Enhanced path traversal protection tests (null bytes, URL encoding)
   - Updated MockAuthenticationService to handle case-insensitive domains
   - Added test for whitespace variations in Bearer token (tabs, multiple spaces)

### Rationale

The enhanced test file contained valuable edge case tests that weren't covered in the main test file. Rather than maintaining two separate test files with duplicated infrastructure, all unique tests were merged into the existing test file following these principles:

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminated duplicate MockAuthenticationService implementation
2. **Test Colocation**: Tests should live next to the code they test (`__tests__` directory)
3. **Consistency**: Maintained existing test patterns, constants, and structure
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Preserved all valuable edge case tests

### Production Readiness Improvements

- Better test organization with clear describe blocks for different test categories
- Consistent use of test constants and helper functions
- Proper documentation for each test section
- Fixed incorrect test expectations (e.g., tabs in Bearer tokens are actually accepted)

### No Breaking Changes

All tests continue to pass, and the functionality remains unchanged. This was purely a test organization improvement.
