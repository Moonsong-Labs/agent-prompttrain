# API Authentication Middleware Refactoring

**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**File**: `services/proxy/src/middleware/api-auth.ts`  
**Branch**: `file-grooming-07-18`

## Summary

Refactored the API authentication middleware to improve security, consistency, and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Security Improvements
- **Fixed timing attack vulnerability**: Replaced direct string comparison with `crypto.timingSafeEqual`
- **Standardized error responses**: Now consistently returns 401 for all authentication failures to prevent information leakage (previously mixed 401/403)

### 2. Code Quality Improvements
- **Added constants**: Defined `AUTH_HEADERS` constant to eliminate magic strings
- **Removed deprecated env var**: Removed support for `INTERNAL_API_KEY`, standardizing on `DASHBOARD_API_KEY`
- **Enhanced documentation**: Added comprehensive JSDoc comments explaining purpose, configuration, and supported headers

### 3. Testing
- **Created test suite**: Added comprehensive unit tests in `__tests__/api-auth.test.ts` with 8 test cases covering:
  - Bypass when auth disabled
  - Missing API key handling
  - All supported header formats
  - Invalid key rejection
  - Timing-safe comparison verification
  - Header preference order

### 4. Related Updates
- Updated `services/dashboard/src/services/api-client.ts` to remove `INTERNAL_API_KEY` fallback

## Rationale

This middleware is security-critical as it protects all dashboard API endpoints. The timing attack vulnerability could have allowed attackers to potentially guess API keys through timing analysis. The refactoring brings the code up to industry security standards while improving maintainability.

## Backward Compatibility

All existing header formats remain supported:
- `X-Dashboard-Key` (preferred)
- `X-API-Key` (legacy)
- `Authorization: Bearer <key>` (OAuth-style)

## Test Results

All tests pass successfully:
- 8 tests, 0 failures
- TypeScript compilation successful
- ESLint checks pass
