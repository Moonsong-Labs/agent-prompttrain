# .prettierignore Refactoring Log

**Date**: 2025-01-21
**Sprint Focus**: File grooming for production-ready repository
**File**: `.prettierignore`

## Summary

Refactored `.prettierignore` to align with the project's actual technology stack (Bun/Hono monorepo) and improve maintainability.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed irrelevant framework entries**:
   - Removed `.next` (Next.js specific)
   - Removed `.nuxt` (Nuxt specific)
   - Removed `.parcel-cache` (Parcel specific)
   - These frameworks are not used in this Bun/Hono project

2. **Updated Docker patterns**:
   - Changed from `Dockerfile*` and `docker-compose*.yml` to `docker/`
   - This properly ignores the entire docker directory where these files actually reside
   - More robust and simpler approach

3. **Removed redundant package manager lock files**:
   - Removed `package-lock.json` (npm)
   - Removed `yarn.lock` (Yarn)
   - Removed `pnpm-lock.yaml` (pnpm)
   - Kept only `bun.lockb` as this is a Bun project

4. **Added SQL file patterns**:
   - Added `*.sql` to preserve custom SQL formatting
   - Added `text.sql` specifically (found at root level)
   - SQL files often have manual formatting that shouldn't be auto-formatted

5. **Improved organization**:
   - Better section comments for clarity
   - Grouped related entries together
   - More logical flow

6. **Added coverage directory**:
   - Added `coverage` to build output section
   - Anticipating future test coverage reports

7. **Simplified log entries**:
   - Removed specific log pattern variations (npm-debug.log\*, etc.)
   - Kept generic `*.log` pattern which covers all cases

## Validation

- Confirmed with Gemini 2.5 Pro (10/10 confidence score)
- Tested with `bun run format:check` - working correctly
- Verified SQL files are properly ignored
- Verified docker directory is properly ignored

## Benefits

1. **Reduced cognitive overhead**: Removed irrelevant entries that don't apply to this project
2. **Better maintainability**: Clearer organization with comments
3. **Future-proof**: Ignoring entire directories (like `docker/`) is more robust than specific file patterns
4. **Project-specific**: Now accurately reflects the Bun/Hono technology stack

## Best Practices Applied

- Keep configuration files lean and project-specific
- Use directory-level ignores when appropriate
- Add clear comments for maintainability
- Remove framework-specific entries that don't apply
- Preserve manual formatting for SQL files by default

## No ADR Required

This change is a straightforward cleanup/maintenance task that doesn't introduce new architectural patterns or significant technical decisions. It's a routine grooming activity to keep configuration files accurate and maintainable.
