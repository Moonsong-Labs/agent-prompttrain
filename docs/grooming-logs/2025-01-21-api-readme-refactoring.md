# API README Refactoring

**Date**: 2025-01-21
**File**: docs/api/README.md
**Sprint**: file-grooming-07-18

## Summary

Refactored the API documentation README to serve as a focused directory index for OpenAPI specifications, removing mixed concerns and outdated references.

## Changes Made

### 1. Content Restructuring

- Transformed from a mixed API documentation/guide into a clean directory index
- Removed redundant content about "optional" client generation
- Simplified the structure to focus solely on OpenAPI specifications

### 2. Fixed Issues

- Removed outdated GitHub URL reference (was pointing to Moonsong-Labs)
- Improved Docker command formatting with proper line breaks
- Removed unnecessary authentication examples (belongs in API reference)

### 3. Added Clarity

- Clear statement that this directory contains machine-readable specifications
- Added links to user-facing documentation (API Reference and Dashboard Guide)
- Better organization of tools and workflows for working with OpenAPI specs

### 4. Content Reduction

- Reduced file from 90 lines to 60 lines (33% reduction)
- Removed duplicate information available in other documentation
- Kept only essential information for working with OpenAPI specifications

## Rationale

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The directory README should focus on what's in the directory (OpenAPI specs) rather than how to use the APIs (which belongs in user guides)

2. **Maintainability**: By removing specific API details and examples, the file is less likely to become outdated when APIs change

3. **Clarity**: Users looking for API documentation are directed to the appropriate user guides, while developers working with OpenAPI specs have the tools they need

4. **DRY Principle**: Removed content that was duplicated in other documentation files

## Impact

- No functional changes to the project
- Improved documentation organization
- Clearer navigation for users and developers
- Reduced maintenance burden
