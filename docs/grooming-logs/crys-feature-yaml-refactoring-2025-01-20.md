# Grooming Log: crys-feature.yaml Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-01-20
**File:** `services/proxy/prompts/crys-feature.yaml`
**Branch:** file-grooming-07-18

## Summary

Refactored the MCP prompt file `crys-feature.yaml` to improve clarity, maintainability, and production readiness. Reduced file size from 110 lines to 84 lines while enhancing structure and fixing multiple issues.

## Issues Identified

1. **Grammar and Spelling Errors:**
   - "recommandation" → "recommendation"
   - "documentations" → "documentation"
   - "because taking conclusions" → "before taking conclusions"
   - "even iif" → "even if"

2. **Invalid YAML Syntax:**
   - `!`find docs/ -name '\*.md' | sort`` - Not valid YAML or template syntax

3. **Structural Issues:**
   - Overly complex nested structure with redundant instructions
   - Mixed concerns between persistent rules and workflow steps
   - Unclear separation of responsibilities

4. **Naming Issues:**
   - Generic name "Feature" didn't match descriptive filename
   - Lacked clear definition of what constitutes a "feature"

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Name and Description:**
   - Changed from "Feature" to "Feature Development Assistant"
   - Made description more specific about the prompt's purpose

2. **Restructured Content:**
   - Separated into clear sections: Context, Guiding Principles, and Workflow
   - Created numbered workflow: Setup → Planning → Implementation → Validation → Completion
   - Consolidated redundant instructions

3. **Fixed All Language Issues:**
   - Corrected all grammar and spelling errors
   - Improved clarity and readability throughout

4. **Replaced Invalid Syntax:**
   - Changed invalid documentation reference to proper shell commands
   - Made documentation discovery an explicit action step

5. **Clarified AI Assistant Interactions:**
   - Named assistants explicitly (planning_assistant, code_reviewer, verification_assistant)
   - Defined clear roles for each assistant

6. **Added Missing Context:**
   - Defined what a "feature" means in this context
   - Added specific guidance for common scenarios (TypeScript, monorepos, CI/CD)

## Rationale

This refactoring was necessary to:

- Make the prompt production-ready for public release
- Improve maintainability by reducing complexity
- Ensure AI agents can follow instructions clearly
- Fix technical issues that could cause parsing errors
- Align with project standards for documentation and code quality

## Validation

- Validated YAML syntax using Python yaml parser
- Received consensus from Gemini Pro and O3-mini on refactoring approach
- Confirmed MCP services exist to load and serve this prompt
- Maintained all essential functionality while improving structure

## Impact

This change only affects the single prompt file. No other code changes were required as the MCP system loads prompts dynamically from YAML files. The improved structure will make it easier for AI agents to develop features consistently and reliably.
