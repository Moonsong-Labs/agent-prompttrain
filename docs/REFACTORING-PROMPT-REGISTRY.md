# PromptRegistryService Refactoring Documentation

## Date: 2025-01-19

## Overview

Refactored `services/proxy/src/mcp/PromptRegistryService.ts` to improve type safety, error handling, memory management, and code organization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Type Safety Improvements

- **Fixed FSWatcher type**: Changed `watcher?: fs.FileHandle` to `watcher?: FSWatcher` for correct typing
- **Removed `as any` casts**: Eliminated type casting in lines 110 and 156
- **Used shared types**: Replaced local `PromptFile` interface with shared `YamlPromptFormat` from `./types/prompts.js`

### 2. Error Handling Enhancements

- **Preserved cache on errors**: No longer clears the entire cache when directory read fails, maintaining last known good state
- **Better error context**: All errors now include structured metadata for better debugging
- **Graceful degradation**: Service continues operating with existing cache even if file operations fail

### 3. Memory Leak Prevention

- **Fixed debounce implementation**: Added proper timeout cancellation to prevent multiple reload operations
- **Concurrent reload prevention**: Added `isLoadingPrompts` flag to prevent race conditions
- **Cleanup on stop**: Properly clear timeouts when service stops

### 4. Logging Improvements

- **Replaced console.log**: All logging now uses the structured logger service
- **Added metadata**: All log entries include relevant context (file names, directories, error details)
- **Appropriate log levels**: Using info, warn, error, and debug levels appropriately

### 5. Configuration Support

- **Honor watchFiles setting**: File watching now respects `config.mcp.watchFiles` configuration
- **Conditional initialization**: Only starts file watcher when enabled in configuration

### 6. Code Organization

- **Extracted constants**: File extensions and debounce delay moved to constants
- **Separated concerns**: File change handling extracted to dedicated method
- **Better modularity**: Clear separation between initialization, loading, and watching logic

### 7. Feature Improvements

- **Honor YAML name field**: Now uses the `name` field from YAML files when present, falling back to filename
- **Consistent file extension handling**: Centralized supported extension checking

## Benefits

1. **Production Readiness**: Better error handling and resource management for production environments
2. **Maintainability**: Cleaner code structure and proper typing make future changes easier
3. **Debuggability**: Structured logging with metadata aids in troubleshooting
4. **Performance**: Prevents memory leaks and unnecessary reload operations
5. **Configurability**: Respects system configuration for file watching

## Testing

Created and ran a test script that verified:

- Prompt loading from YAML files
- Template compilation and rendering
- Proper error handling for missing prompts
- File watching initialization
- Clean shutdown

All functionality remains intact with improved reliability and maintainability.
