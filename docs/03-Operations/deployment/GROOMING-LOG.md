# Docker Compose Documentation Grooming Log

**Date**: 2025-01-21
**File**: `docs/03-Operations/deployment/docker-compose.md`
**Branch**: file-grooming-07-18

## Issues Identified

1. **Outdated/Inaccurate Information**:
   - Placeholder repository URL ("yourusername")
   - Non-existent Docker registry images ("alanpurestake")
   - Database name mismatch (doc: "claude_nexus", actual: "claude_proxy")
   - Incorrect port configurations

2. **Missing Current Implementation**:
   - No mention of docker-up.sh (the recommended approach)
   - Missing Claude CLI service documentation
   - No reference to locally built images
   - Incorrect docker-compose.yml location

3. **Unnecessary Content**:
   - Extensive hypothetical features (SSL, HAProxy, Prometheus)
   - Complex production scenarios not implemented
   - 508 lines of mostly aspirational content

4. **Path Errors**:
   - Wrong path for generate-api-key.ts script
   - Generic migration command that doesn't exist

## Changes Made

### Complete Rewrite (508 → 189 lines)

1. **Aligned with Actual Implementation**:
   - Documented docker-up.sh as primary interface
   - Referenced actual docker/docker-compose.yml location
   - Used correct database name (claude_proxy)
   - Included all 5 actual services (including Claude CLI)

2. **Removed Hypothetical Content**:
   - Deleted unimplemented SSL/TLS sections
   - Removed HAProxy load balancing
   - Removed Prometheus/Grafana monitoring
   - Removed complex scaling scenarios

3. **Fixed Technical Accuracy**:
   - Corrected repository URL to Moonsong-Labs
   - Fixed generate-api-key.ts path
   - Updated migration example to use actual scripts
   - Reflected locally built images

4. **Simplified Structure**:
   - Focused on practical developer usage
   - Kept only relevant troubleshooting
   - Referenced actual files and scripts
   - Reduced from 508 to 189 lines (63% reduction)

## Rationale

This documentation was clearly written aspirationally, describing features that don't exist. For production-ready documentation, it's crucial to:

1. **Be Accurate**: Document what exists, not what might exist
2. **Be Concise**: Developers need quick, accurate references
3. **Be Maintainable**: Simpler docs are easier to keep updated
4. **Avoid Duplication**: Reference source files rather than duplicating

The refactored version serves as a practical guide for developers using Docker Compose with the project, focusing on the actual implementation rather than hypothetical scenarios.

## Impact

- Developers can now follow the documentation successfully
- Reduced maintenance burden (189 vs 508 lines)
- Accurate reflection of project structure
- Clear path from setup to usage

## Verification

All referenced files and commands were verified to exist:

- ✓ docker-up.sh script
- ✓ docker/docker-compose.yml
- ✓ scripts/auth/generate-api-key.ts
- ✓ Database name: claude_proxy
- ✓ Repository: Moonsong-Labs/claude-nexus-proxy
