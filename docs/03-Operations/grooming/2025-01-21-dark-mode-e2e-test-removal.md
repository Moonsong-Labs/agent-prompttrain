# Dark Mode E2E Test Removal - January 21, 2025

## Summary

Removed `e2e/dark-mode.test.ts` as part of repository grooming to maintain a clean, production-ready test suite.

## Rationale

The test file was identified as redundant and creating unnecessary maintenance burden:

1. **Redundant Coverage** - Dark mode functionality is already comprehensively tested via:
   - Integration tests: `services/dashboard/src/routes/__tests__/dark-mode.integration.test.ts`
   - This provides adequate coverage at the appropriate testing level

2. **Brittle Implementation** - The E2E test had multiple maintenance issues:
   - Hard-coded RGB color values (e.g., `rgb(15, 23, 42)`) that break with CSS changes
   - Fragile keyboard navigation requiring exactly 6 Tab presses
   - Tightly coupled selectors like `a[href="/dashboard/requests"]`
   - Testing implementation details rather than user behavior

3. **Testing Best Practices Violation** - According to the testing pyramid/trophy:
   - E2E tests should focus on critical user journeys (authentication, data processing)
   - UI preferences like theme toggling are best tested at the integration level
   - E2E tests are expensive to maintain and should be minimized

4. **Consistency with Recent Changes** - The project recently removed `e2e/dark-mode-components.test.ts` for similar reasons

## Validation

Gemini-2.5-pro model confirmed with 9/10 confidence that removing this test:

- Aligns with modern testing best practices
- Reduces maintenance burden and CI/CD noise
- Focuses E2E testing resources on critical functionality
- Maintains adequate test coverage through existing integration tests

## Impact

- **No functional changes** - Dark mode continues to work as expected
- **Reduced test maintenance** - Eliminates brittle tests that frequently break
- **Improved test suite focus** - E2E tests now concentrate on critical user paths
- **Better developer experience** - Less time spent fixing flaky tests

## Alternative Considered

Refactoring the E2E test to be more robust was considered but rejected because:

- The effort would not be justified for a simple UI preference feature
- Integration tests already provide the appropriate level of coverage
- Resources are better spent on E2E tests for critical functionality
