# Theme Test Removal - January 20, 2025

## Summary

Removed `services/dashboard/src/layout/__tests__/theme.test.ts` as part of repository grooming.

## Rationale

The test file was identified as providing no real value and creating maintenance burden:

1. **Testing mocks instead of functionality** - The test only verified mocked DOM elements and localStorage behavior, not the actual theme toggle implementation
2. **Implementation constraints** - The theme toggle is implemented as an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) script string, making unit testing impractical without major refactoring
3. **Redundant coverage** - Theme functionality is already comprehensively tested via:
   - Integration tests: `services/dashboard/src/routes/__tests__/dark-mode.integration.test.ts`
   - E2E tests: `e2e/dark-mode.test.ts` and `e2e/dark-mode-components.test.ts`
4. **Code smell** - The test duplicated implementation logic rather than testing actual behavior

## Validation

Both Gemini and O3 models confirmed that deleting redundant tests that only test mocks is a best practice for maintaining a clean, production-ready codebase.

## Impact

- No functional changes
- Reduced test maintenance burden
- Cleaner test suite focused on valuable tests
- All existing integration and E2E tests continue to pass

## Alternative Considered

Refactoring the IIFE implementation to make it unit-testable was considered but rejected as over-engineering for a simple theme toggle feature that's already well-tested at higher levels.
