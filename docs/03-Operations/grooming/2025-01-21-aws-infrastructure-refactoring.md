# AWS Infrastructure Documentation Refactoring

**Date**: 2025-01-21  
**File**: `docs/03-Operations/deployment/aws-infrastructure.md`  
**Sprint**: Repository Grooming - Production Readiness

## Summary

Transformed the AWS infrastructure documentation from an aspirational, hypothetical guide to an accurate, practical deployment guide that reflects the actual implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Aspirational Content

- **Removed**: Terraform configuration examples that don't exist in the project
- **Removed**: Multi-region deployment section (not implemented)
- **Removed**: Future enhancement references like `--region` flag
- **Removed**: Complex disaster recovery and failover procedures
- **Removed**: CloudWatch dashboard creation examples
- **Removed**: Compliance and data residency sections

### 2. Updated Technical Details

- **Changed**: Ubuntu version from 20.04 to 22.04 LTS
- **Changed**: Placeholder GitHub URLs to generic `<your-repository-url>`
- **Simplified**: Environment configuration examples to realistic values

### 3. Focused on Actual Implementation

- **Added**: Clear documentation of what `manage-nexus-proxies.sh` actually does
- **Added**: Practical troubleshooting section with common issues
- **Added**: Debug commands that operators can actually use
- **Added**: Basic health monitoring setup
- **Enhanced**: Security best practices based on real deployment needs

### 4. Improved Structure

- **Reorganized**: Content to follow a logical deployment flow
- **Consolidated**: Redundant sections about environment management
- **Added**: Clear links to related documentation

## Rationale

The original documentation contained extensive hypothetical features and configurations that could mislead users trying to deploy the system. By focusing on what's actually implemented, the documentation now:

1. **Provides accurate guidance** - Users can follow the steps and achieve success
2. **Sets realistic expectations** - No promises of features that don't exist
3. **Reduces confusion** - Clear distinction between what's available and what's not
4. **Improves maintainability** - Documentation matches the codebase

## Impact

- **Positive**: Users can now successfully deploy on AWS following the guide
- **Positive**: Reduced maintenance burden for keeping docs in sync
- **Neutral**: Some advanced features are no longer documented (but they didn't exist anyway)

## Related Files

- `scripts/ops/manage-nexus-proxies.sh` - The actual implementation
- `docs/03-Operations/deployment/ops-scripts.md` - Detailed script documentation
- `docs/03-Operations/deployment/docker.md` - Container deployment options

## Future Considerations

If advanced features like multi-region deployment or Terraform configurations are implemented in the future, they should be added back with actual working examples rather than hypothetical ones.
