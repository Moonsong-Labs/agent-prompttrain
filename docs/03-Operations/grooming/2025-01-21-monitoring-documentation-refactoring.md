# Monitoring Documentation Refactoring

**Date**: 2025-01-21
**File**: `docs/03-Operations/monitoring.md`
**Author**: Claude (AI Assistant)

## Summary

Refactored the monitoring documentation to remove unimplemented features and align with actual system capabilities.

## Changes Made

### Removed

1. **Unimplemented Integrations**
   - Prometheus metrics endpoint (doesn't exist)
   - Grafana dashboard configuration
   - UptimeRobot external monitoring
   - Filebeat log shipping

2. **Outdated Information**
   - Old Claude 3 model pricing
   - Incorrect API endpoints
   - docker-compose commands (replaced with docker-up.sh)

3. **Verbose Code Examples**
   - JavaScript implementation examples
   - Inline configuration files
   - Hypothetical alert configurations

### Added

1. **Actual Monitoring Features**
   - AI analysis job monitoring with real scripts
   - MCP server health checks
   - Correct API endpoints with examples
   - Practical SQL queries for monitoring

2. **Operational Guidance**
   - Clear command examples using docker-up.sh
   - Actual log filtering commands
   - References to real utility scripts

### Updated

1. **Structure**
   - Added timestamp
   - Reorganized sections logically
   - Focused on operational tasks

2. **Content**
   - All API endpoints verified against codebase
   - Commands tested for accuracy
   - Added links to related documentation

## Rationale

The monitoring documentation was aspirational rather than factual, containing many unimplemented features. This caused confusion and made it difficult to actually monitor the system. The refactored version focuses exclusively on what's implemented and provides practical guidance for operators.

## Testing

- Verified all API endpoints exist in the codebase
- Checked all relative links are valid
- Confirmed SQL queries are syntactically correct
- Validated docker-up.sh commands

## Impact

Users now have accurate documentation for monitoring their Claude Nexus Proxy deployment. The removed features can be added back when actually implemented.
