# Docker Deployment Documentation Refactoring

**Date**: 2025-01-21
**File**: `docs/03-Operations/deployment/docker.md`
**Author**: Claude (AI Assistant)

## Summary

Refactored the Docker deployment documentation to eliminate duplication, remove aspirational content, and improve clarity by separating deployment concerns from operational procedures.

## Changes Made

### 1. Focused Scope

- Transformed from general "Deployment Guide" to specific "Docker Deployment Guide"
- Removed Docker Compose section (already covered in docker-compose.md)
- Removed Kubernetes section (kubernetes/ directory doesn't exist)
- Removed bare metal deployment with Bun section

### 2. Content Restructuring

- Clear focus on building and running standalone Docker containers
- Added production-focused Docker run examples with health checks
- Improved security practices section
- Added container networking guidance
- Simplified data persistence section

### 3. Operational Separation

- Created new `docs/03-Operations/operations.md` file
- Moved all operational concerns to the new operations guide:
  - Health monitoring
  - Logging procedures
  - Metrics collection
  - Troubleshooting
  - Maintenance tasks
  - Security operations
  - Performance tuning
  - Disaster recovery

### 4. Updated References

- Added clear navigation notes at the top pointing to related guides
- Updated all cross-references to be accurate
- Removed references to non-existent features

## Rationale

### Why These Changes?

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each document now has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Reduced Duplication**: Docker Compose instructions are no longer duplicated
3. **Accuracy**: Removed references to non-existent Kubernetes setup
4. **Maintainability**: Operational procedures that change frequently are now separate
5. **User Experience**: Users can find exactly what they need without wading through unrelated content

### Benefits

- **For Deployment Users**: Clear, focused instructions for Docker deployment
- **For Operations Teams**: Comprehensive operational procedures in one place
- **For Maintainers**: Easier to update specific sections without affecting others

## Impact

- No breaking changes to functionality
- All existing references to docker.md remain valid
- New operations.md provides better organization for operational content
- Improved documentation structure aligns with best practices

## Testing

Verified that:

- All internal links are correct
- Referenced scripts and commands exist
- No broken references from other documents
- Content is accurate based on actual project structure

## Next Steps

Consider:

- Adding more Docker security best practices
- Creating specific runbooks for common operational scenarios
- Adding monitoring dashboard setup instructions in operations.md
