# Code Quality Scan Report

## Summary

This report identifies common code quality issues found in the `services/proxy/src` and `services/dashboard/src` directories.

## Issues Found

### 1. Unused Exports (26 modules affected)

Many modules have exports that are never imported elsewhere in the codebase. This creates code bloat and maintenance burden.

**Most affected files:**

- `/services/proxy/src/credentials.ts` - 11 unused exports
- `/services/proxy/src/types/errors.ts` - 6 unused exports
- `/services/proxy/src/services/database.ts` - 3 unused exports
- `/services/proxy/src/middleware/rate-limit.ts` - 1 unused export
- `/services/proxy/src/services/TestSampleCollector.ts` - 1 unused export

**Recommendation:** Run `npx ts-unused-exports` regularly and remove unused exports.

### 2. Console Statements in Production Code

Found multiple `console.log` and `console.error` statements that should use the proper logger:

**Files with console statements:**

- `/services/proxy/src/routes/spark-api.ts` - 3 console.error statements
- `/services/proxy/src/main.ts` - 20+ console.log statements

**Recommendation:** Replace all console statements with the structured logger (`logger.info()`, `logger.error()`, etc.)

### 3. Duplicate Error Handling Patterns

The `/services/proxy/src/routes/api.ts` file has repetitive error handling code in every endpoint:

```typescript
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to get X', { error: getErrorMessage(error) })
  return c.json({ error: 'Failed to retrieve X' }, 500)
}
```

**Recommendation:** Create a common error handling middleware or utility function to reduce duplication.

### 4. Large Files That Need Refactoring

Several files exceed reasonable size limits and should be split:

- `/services/proxy/src/routes/api.ts` - 879 lines
- `/services/proxy/src/routes/__tests__/analyses.test.ts` - 568 lines
- `/services/proxy/src/routes/analyses.ts` - 391 lines
- `/services/proxy/src/main.ts` - 390 lines
- `/services/proxy/src/app.ts` - 354 lines

**Recommendation:** Break these files into smaller, focused modules. For example, `api.ts` could be split into separate files for stats, requests, conversations, and token usage endpoints.

### 5. Missing Error Handling

Some async functions don't have proper try-catch blocks, which could lead to unhandled promise rejections.

**Recommendation:** Ensure all async route handlers and service methods have proper error handling.

### 6. No Malicious Code Detected

- No use of `eval()`, `exec()`, or `Function()` constructor
- No SQL string concatenation (preventing SQL injection)
- No hardcoded secrets or API keys found in the code

### 7. Type Safety Concerns

Some files use `any` type which defeats TypeScript's purpose:

- Error handling often casts to `any` to access properties
- Some API response handling uses `any`

**Recommendation:** Define proper error types and API response interfaces instead of using `any`.

## Priority Recommendations

1. **High Priority:**
   - Remove console statements from production code
   - Add proper error handling to all async functions
   - Refactor large files (especially `api.ts`)

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - Remove unused exports
   - Create shared error handling utilities
   - Replace `any` types with proper interfaces

3. **Low Priority:**
   - Add more comprehensive logging
   - Consider adding code complexity metrics to CI/CD

## Next Steps

1. Set up ESLint rules to catch these issues automatically:
   - no-console rule
   - no-unused-vars rule
   - max-lines rule
   - complexity rule

2. Add pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality standards

3. Consider using tools like SonarQube or CodeClimate for continuous code quality monitoring
