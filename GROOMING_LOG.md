# Grooming Log

## 2025-01-19: packages/shared/README.md Grooming

### File: `packages/shared/README.md`

#### Changes Made:

1. **Updated Overview Section**
   - Enhanced description to clarify the package's purpose
   - Mentioned the three well-defined entry points

2. **Added Installation Section**
   - Clarified that the package is automatically available in the monorepo workspace

3. **Restructured Usage Section**
   - Split into three subsections matching package.json exports: Main Export, Types Export, Config Export
   - Provided comprehensive examples showing what's available from each entry point
   - Aligned documentation with actual exports in package.json

4. **Replaced Contents Section with Available Modules**
   - Listed all modules accessible through the main export
   - Removed directory-based documentation that was incomplete and misleading
   - Focused on functionality rather than file structure

5. **Updated Development Section**
   - Kept existing commands
   - Added typecheck command

6. **Added Testing Section**
   - Documented how to run tests from the monorepo root

7. **Added TypeScript Configuration Section**
   - Mentioned TypeScript Project References usage

8. **Updated Build Output**
   - Corrected to mention ESM only (as per package.json "type": "module")
   - Removed incorrect mention of CommonJS

#### Rationale:

The previous README only documented 3 out of 7+ directories, leading to confusion. Import examples didn't match the actual package.json exports. The new structure follows best practices by documenting the public API (exports) rather than internal structure. This aligns with the principle that README should serve package consumers, not expose internals.

#### Testing:

- Verified `bun run build` succeeds
- Verified `bun run typecheck` passes
- No code changes were made, only documentation updates

## 2025-01-19: Truncation Test Refactoring

### File: `packages/shared/src/prompts/__tests__/truncation.test.ts`

#### Changes Made:

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Reduced test execution time from ~62s to ~48s (22.7% improvement)
   - Replaced excessive string repetitions (350k) with calculated minimums
   - Maintained full test coverage for all edge cases

2. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Removed unused variables (`_HEAD_MESSAGES`, `_firstContentMessage`)
   - Extracted magic numbers to named constants
   - Simplified array creation using `Array.from()` instead of for loops
   - Improved type safety in regex match parsing

3. **Constants Added**
   - `CHARS_PER_TOKEN`: Token to character ratio
   - `MAX_TOKENS`: Maximum token limit
   - `LARGE_MESSAGE_CHARS`: Standard large message size
   - `VERY_LARGE_MESSAGE_CHARS`: Extra large message size
   - `SINGLE_MESSAGE_EXCEED_CHARS`: Size for single message overflow test

#### Rationale:

The original tests were using excessively large strings (up to 15.75M characters) which caused:

- Slow test execution (over 1 minute)
- High memory usage
- Unnecessary CPU cycles

The refactored tests use calculated sizes based on actual tokenizer behavior (~16 chars/token) to:

- Trigger the same edge cases with smaller data
- Reduce memory pressure
- Improve developer experience with faster feedback

All test scenarios remain intact, ensuring the truncation functionality is thoroughly validated.

## 2025-01-19: Compact Branch Preservation Test Refactoring

### File: `packages/shared/src/utils/__tests__/compact-branch-preservation.test.ts`

#### Changes Made:

1. **Deleted the standalone test file**
   - Removed `compact-branch-preservation.test.ts` completely
   - The file contained 2 tests that were inconsistent with project patterns

2. **Created new JSON fixture**
   - Added `10-branch-with-existing-children.json` to cover missing test case
   - Tests branch creation for non-compact conversations with existing children

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Test Organization Inconsistency**
   - The project uses JSON fixtures for conversation linking tests
   - This file contained standalone code-based tests
   - Created inconsistency in test approach and maintenance

2. **Code Duplication**
   - Mock creation and setup code was duplicated
   - Manual hash computation duplicated actual implementation
   - Excessive boilerplate for simple test scenarios

3. **Redundant Coverage**
   - Compact branch preservation test was already covered by `05-compact-follow-up.json`
   - Only the branch creation with existing children scenario was missing

#### Benefits of Refactoring:

- **Consistency**: All conversation linking tests now use JSON fixtures
- **Maintainability**: Data-driven tests are easier to update and understand
- **Reduced Duplication**: No more duplicated mock setup code
- **Centralization**: All related tests in one place with consistent patterns
- **Simplicity**: JSON fixtures are clearer than imperative test code

#### Test Coverage:

- ✅ Compact branch preservation: Already covered by fixture `05-compact-follow-up.json`
- ✅ Branch creation with existing children: Now covered by new fixture `10-branch-with-existing-children.json`
- ✅ All tests continue to pass after refactoring (80 tests, 0 failures)
