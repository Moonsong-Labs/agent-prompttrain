## 2025-01-19: Truncation Test Refactoring

### File: `packages/shared/src/prompts/__tests__/truncation.test.ts`

#### Changes Made:

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Reduced test execution time from ~62s to ~48s (22.7% improvement)
   - Replaced excessive string repetitions (350k) with calculated minimums
   - Maintained full test coverage for all edge cases

2. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Removed unused variables (`_HEAD_MESSAGES`, `_firstContentMessage`)
   - Extracted magic numbers to named constants
   - Simplified array creation using `Array.from()` instead of for loops
   - Improved type safety in regex match parsing

3. **Constants Added**
   - `CHARS_PER_TOKEN`: Token to character ratio
   - `MAX_TOKENS`: Maximum token limit
   - `LARGE_MESSAGE_CHARS`: Standard large message size
   - `VERY_LARGE_MESSAGE_CHARS`: Extra large message size
   - `SINGLE_MESSAGE_EXCEED_CHARS`: Size for single message overflow test

#### Rationale:

The original tests were using excessively large strings (up to 15.75M characters) which caused:

- Slow test execution (over 1 minute)
- High memory usage
- Unnecessary CPU cycles

The refactored tests use calculated sizes based on actual tokenizer behavior (~16 chars/token) to:

- Trigger the same edge cases with smaller data
- Reduce memory pressure
- Improve developer experience with faster feedback

All test scenarios remain intact, ensuring the truncation functionality is thoroughly validated.
