## 2025-01-19: Truncation Test Refactoring

### File: `packages/shared/src/prompts/__tests__/truncation.test.ts`

#### Changes Made:

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Reduced test execution time from ~62s to ~48s (22.7% improvement)
   - Replaced excessive string repetitions (350k) with calculated minimums
   - Maintained full test coverage for all edge cases

2. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Removed unused variables (`_HEAD_MESSAGES`, `_firstContentMessage`)
   - Extracted magic numbers to named constants
   - Simplified array creation using `Array.from()` instead of for loops
   - Improved type safety in regex match parsing

3. **Constants Added**
   - `CHARS_PER_TOKEN`: Token to character ratio
   - `MAX_TOKENS`: Maximum token limit
   - `LARGE_MESSAGE_CHARS`: Standard large message size
   - `VERY_LARGE_MESSAGE_CHARS`: Extra large message size
   - `SINGLE_MESSAGE_EXCEED_CHARS`: Size for single message overflow test

#### Rationale:

The original tests were using excessively large strings (up to 15.75M characters) which caused:

- Slow test execution (over 1 minute)
- High memory usage
- Unnecessary CPU cycles

The refactored tests use calculated sizes based on actual tokenizer behavior (~16 chars/token) to:

- Trigger the same edge cases with smaller data
- Reduce memory pressure
- Improve developer experience with faster feedback

All test scenarios remain intact, ensuring the truncation functionality is thoroughly validated.

## 2025-01-19: Compact Branch Preservation Test Refactoring

### File: `packages/shared/src/utils/__tests__/compact-branch-preservation.test.ts`

#### Changes Made:

1. **Deleted the standalone test file**
   - Removed `compact-branch-preservation.test.ts` completely
   - The file contained 2 tests that were inconsistent with project patterns

2. **Created new JSON fixture**
   - Added `10-branch-with-existing-children.json` to cover missing test case
   - Tests branch creation for non-compact conversations with existing children

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Test Organization Inconsistency**
   - The project uses JSON fixtures for conversation linking tests
   - This file contained standalone code-based tests
   - Created inconsistency in test approach and maintenance

2. **Code Duplication**
   - Mock creation and setup code was duplicated
   - Manual hash computation duplicated actual implementation
   - Excessive boilerplate for simple test scenarios

3. **Redundant Coverage**
   - Compact branch preservation test was already covered by `05-compact-follow-up.json`
   - Only the branch creation with existing children scenario was missing

#### Benefits of Refactoring:

- **Consistency**: All conversation linking tests now use JSON fixtures
- **Maintainability**: Data-driven tests are easier to update and understand
- **Reduced Duplication**: No more duplicated mock setup code
- **Centralization**: All related tests in one place with consistent patterns
- **Simplicity**: JSON fixtures are clearer than imperative test code

#### Test Coverage:

- ✅ Compact branch preservation: Already covered by fixture `05-compact-follow-up.json`
- ✅ Branch creation with existing children: Now covered by new fixture `10-branch-with-existing-children.json`
- ✅ All tests continue to pass after refactoring (80 tests, 0 failures)
