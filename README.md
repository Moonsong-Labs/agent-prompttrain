## 📚 Key Concepts

Understanding these terms will help you navigate Claude Nexus Proxy effectively:

### Core Concepts

- **🗣️ Conversation**: A complete interaction session between a user and Claude, consisting of multiple message exchanges. Each conversation has a unique ID and can span multiple requests.
- **🌳 Branch**: When you edit an earlier message in a conversation and continue from there, it creates a new branch - similar to Git branches. This allows exploring alternative conversation paths without losing the original.
- **📦 Compact**: When a conversation exceeds Claude's context window, it's automatically summarized and continued as a "compact" conversation, preserving the essential context while staying within token limits.
- **🤖 Sub-task**: When Claude spawns another AI agent using the Task tool, it creates a sub-task. These are tracked separately but linked to their parent conversation for complete visibility.

### Technical Terms

- **🔤 Token**: The basic unit of text that Claude processes. Monitoring token usage helps track costs and stay within API limits.
- **📊 Request**: A single API call to Claude, which may contain multiple messages. Conversations are built from multiple requests.
- **🔧 Tool Use**: Claude's ability to use external tools (like file reading, web search, or spawning sub-tasks). Each tool invocation is tracked and displayed.
- **📝 MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: A protocol for managing and sharing prompt templates across teams, with GitHub integration for version control.

### Dashboard Elements

- **Timeline View**: Shows the chronological flow of messages within a conversation
- **Tree View**: Visualizes conversation branches and sub-tasks as an interactive tree
- **Message Hash**: Unique identifier for each message, used to track conversation flow and detect branches

### Conversation Tracking & Visualization

Visualize entire conversation flows as interactive trees, making it easy to understand complex interactions, debug issues, and track conversation branches.

### Detailed Conversation Timeline

Dive deep into individual conversations with a timeline view that shows message flow, token usage, branches, and execution metrics. Filter by branch to focus on specific conversation paths.

### Request Details & Tool Results

Examine individual API requests and responses with syntax highlighting, tool result visualization, and comprehensive metadata including token counts and timing information.

### Raw JSON Debugging

For developers who need complete visibility, access the raw JSON view of any request or response with syntax highlighting and expandable tree structure.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime (v1.0+)
- PostgreSQL database
- Claude Plan (_or Claude API Key_)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/claude-nexus-proxy.git
cd claude-nexus-proxy

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Start development servers
bun run dev
```

The proxy runs on `http://localhost:3000` and dashboard on `http://localhost:3001`.

### Using Claude Code with the Proxy

Run Claude CLI connected to your local proxy:

```bash
API_TIMEOUT_MS=300000 DISABLE_NON_ESSENTIAL_MODEL_CALLS=1 ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 claude
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Essential configuration:

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/claude_nexus

# Dashboard Authentication
# ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING: Without this key, the dashboard runs in read-only mode
# with NO authentication, exposing ALL conversation data to anyone with network access!
# NEVER deploy to production without setting this!
DASHBOARD_API_KEY=your-secure-key

# Optional Features
STORAGE_ENABLED=true
DEBUG=false
```

See the [Documentation](docs/README.md) for complete configuration options.

### Domain Credentials

Create domain-specific credentials:

```bash
# Generate secure API key
bun run auth:generate-key

# Create credential file
cat > credentials/example.com.credentials.json << EOF
{
  "type": "api_key",
  "accountId": "acc_name_to_display",
  "api_key": "sk-ant-...",
  "client_api_key": "cnp_live_..."
}
EOF
```

(_Use `credentials/localhost\:3000.credentials.json` for using it locally_)

Authenticate your credential with Claude MAX Plan:

```bash
./scripts/auth/oauth-login.ts credentials/example.com.credentials.json
```

## Usage

### API Proxy

Use the proxy exactly like Claude's API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CLIENT_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-3-opus-20240229",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

### Dashboard

Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3001` with your `DASHBOARD_API_KEY`.

**⚠️ Security Warning**: If `DASHBOARD_API_KEY` is not set, the dashboard runs in read-only mode without any authentication, exposing all conversation data. This should NEVER be used in production. See the [Security Guide](docs/03-Operations/security.md) for details.

Features:

- Real-time request monitoring
- Conversation visualization with branching
- Token usage analytics
- Request history browsing
