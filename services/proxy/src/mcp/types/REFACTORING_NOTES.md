# MCP Protocol Types Refactoring

## Date: 2025-01-20

## Summary

Refactored the protocol.ts file to improve type safety, documentation, and alignment with TypeScript best practices.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Replaced `any` types with proper generics**

- Made `JsonRpcRequest`, `JsonRpcResponse`, and `JsonRpcError` generic
- Used `unknown` as the default type parameter for better type safety
- Updated `arguments` field in `GetPromptParams` to use `Record<string, unknown>`

### 2. **Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation**

- Added detailed documentation for all interfaces
- Included `@template` tags for generic types
- Added `@see` references to MCP specification
- Documented all fields with their purpose

### 3. **Introduced type literals for better type safety**

- Added `PromptContentType` type for valid content types
- Added `PromptMessageRole` type for valid message roles
- Added `McpErrorCode` type derived from `MCP_ERRORS`

### 4. **Added type guards**

- `isJsonRpcError()` - Check if response is an error
- `isJsonRpcSuccess()` - Check if response is successful

### 5. **Created utility types**

- `McpMethodMap` - Central mapping of methods to their types
- `McpRequest<M>` - Strongly typed MCP request
- `McpResponse<M>` - Strongly typed MCP response

### 6. **Updated dependent files**

- Updated `JsonRpcHandler.ts` to use generic types
- Updated `McpServer.ts` to use proper type parameters

## Benefits

1. **Better Type Safety**: Eliminates runtime errors from type mismatches
2. **Improved Developer Experience**: IntelliSense now provides accurate type information
3. **Self-Documenting Code**: JSDoc comments provide inline documentation
4. **Future-Proof**: Generic types allow for easy extension
5. **Error Prevention**: Type guards ensure safe type narrowing

## Backward Compatibility

The changes maintain backward compatibility while improving type safety. Existing code continues to work, but now benefits from better type inference.

## Testing

All existing tests pass. No MCP-specific tests were found, indicating the need for future test coverage improvements.
