# Message Formatting Test Grooming Summary

## Date: 2025-01-21

### Overview

Groomed the `message-formatting.test.ts` file as part of the repository cleanup for production readiness.

### Changes Made

1. **File Relocation**
   - **From**: `test/unit/message-formatting.test.ts`
   - **To**: `services/proxy/tests/message-formatting.test.ts`
   - **Rationale**: Tests should be co-located with the service they test. This follows the project pattern where proxy-specific tests reside in `services/proxy/tests/`.

2. **Import Path Updates**
   - **From**: `../../services/proxy/src/domain/entities/`
   - **To**: `../src/domain/entities/`
   - **Rationale**: Simplified relative imports after moving the file to the correct location.

3. **Documentation Header Added**
   - Added comprehensive JSDoc header explaining the test file's purpose and what it covers
   - Lists all test scenarios for better discoverability

4. **Test Coverage Improvements**
   - Added 5 new test cases for `getUserContentForNotification()` method
   - Covers edge cases including:
     - Non-inference requests (no filtering)
     - Inference requests with system reminder filtering
     - Handling of 2 or fewer text blocks
     - Mixed content types (text + images)
     - Edge case where all content gets filtered

### Technical Details

- **Total Tests**: 17 (12 existing + 5 new)
- **All tests passing**: âœ…
- **No breaking changes**: The entities being tested (`ProxyRequest` and `ProxyResponse`) remain unchanged

### Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Tests are now properly located within the service they test
2. **Improved Coverage**: Added missing test coverage for notification content filtering logic
3. **Better Documentation**: Clear header explains the test file's purpose
4. **Maintainability**: Simplified imports and clearer structure make the tests easier to maintain

### No ADR Required

This change follows existing project patterns and doesn't introduce new architectural decisions. It's a straightforward test reorganization and improvement.
