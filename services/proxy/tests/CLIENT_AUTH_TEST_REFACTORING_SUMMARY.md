# Client Auth Test Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Refactored `client-auth.test.ts` to improve code quality, maintainability, and test coverage as part of the repository grooming sprint.

## Changes Made

### 1. Test Location

- **Before**: `services/proxy/tests/client-auth.test.ts`
- **After**: `services/proxy/src/middleware/__tests__/client-auth.test.ts`
- **Rationale**: Aligned with existing pattern where middleware tests are co-located with source files

### 2. Code Organization Improvements

- Extracted all magic strings/numbers into well-named constants
- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments for test suites
- Created a test helper function `makeAuthRequest` to reduce code duplication
- Fixed the nested `afterEach` inside `beforeEach` anti-pattern
- Improved variable naming and test descriptions

### 3. Test Coverage Enhancements

- Added test for malformed Authorization headers
- Added test for case-insensitive Bearer token acceptance
- Added test for concurrent request handling
- Enhanced security tests with more edge cases
- Added more descriptive test cases for timing attack prevention

### 4. Constants Extracted

```typescript
const HTTP_STATUS = {
  OK: 200,
  BAD_REQUEST: 400,
  UNAUTHORIZED: 401,
  INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR: 500,
}

const AUTH_HEADERS = {
  HOST: 'Host',
  AUTHORIZATION: 'Authorization',
  WWW_AUTHENTICATE: 'WWW-Authenticate',
}

const TEST_DOMAINS = {
  EXAMPLE: 'example.com',
  DOMAIN1: 'domain1.com',
  DOMAIN2: 'domain2.com',
}

const TEST_API_KEYS = {
  VALID: 'cnp_live_validtestkey123',
  DOMAIN1: 'cnp_live_domain1key',
  DOMAIN2: 'cnp_live_domain2key',
  WRONG: 'cnp_live_wrongkey',
  SECURE: 'cnp_live_securekey123',
  PORT_TEST: 'cnp_live_porttest',
}
```

### 5. Test Structure Improvements

- Better grouping of related tests
- More descriptive test names
- Clear separation of concerns between test suites
- Added documentation comments explaining the purpose of each test suite

## Results

- All 15 tests passing
- No functionality changes, only code quality improvements
- Better maintainability and readability
- Consistent with project testing patterns

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. Consider migrating other test files from `tests/` to co-located `__tests__` directories
2. Create a project-wide test utilities module for shared test helpers
3. Document the preferred test organization pattern in project guidelines
