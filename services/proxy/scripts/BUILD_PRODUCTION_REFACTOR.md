# Build Production Script Refactoring Summary

## Date: 2025-01-20

## File: services/proxy/scripts/build-production.ts

## Issues Addressed

1. **Cross-platform Incompatibility**
   - Problem: Used Linux-specific `stat -c%s` command that fails on macOS/Windows
   - Solution: Replaced with Bun's cross-platform `Bun.file().size` API

2. **Hardcoded Values**
   - Problem: Package version, name, and dependency versions were hardcoded
   - Solution: Read values dynamically from package.json files

3. **Monorepo Dependency Handling**
   - Problem: Script didn't handle dependencies defined at root level (like `pg`)
   - Solution: Check both local and root package.json for dependencies

4. **Path Handling for Windows**
   - Problem: Mixed use of path separators could cause issues on Windows
   - Solution: Convert paths to forward slashes for shell commands

5. **Build Verification**
   - Problem: No check if build outputs were created successfully
   - Solution: Added existence check for main.js after build

6. **Error Context**
   - Problem: Generic error messages didn't indicate what failed
   - Solution: Enhanced error handling with detailed messages and stack traces

## Code Changes

- Added `readFileSync` import to read package.json files
- Added dynamic reading of both proxy and root package.json
- Replaced `stat` command with `Bun.file().size` API
- Added path normalization for cross-platform shell commands
- Added build output verification
- Enhanced error messages with context
- Added comments explaining production optimizations

## Testing

- ✅ Local build tested successfully
- ✅ Docker build tested successfully
- ✅ Output package.json correctly includes all external dependencies
- ✅ File sizes reported correctly

## Impact

- No breaking changes
- Improved cross-platform compatibility
- Better maintainability with dynamic values
- More robust error handling
- Same output as before but more reliable

## Next Steps

- Consider moving external dependency list to configuration
- Could add option to skip source maps for smaller builds
- May want to add build time reporting
