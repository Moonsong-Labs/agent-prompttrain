## Development

````bash
# Install dependencies
cd services/dashboard
bun install

# Run in development mode
bun run dev

# Build for production
bun run build

# Run tests
bun test

### E2E (Playwright)

Repository-level Playwright tests exercise the dashboard UI end-to-end.

```bash
# One-time: install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install --with-deps

# From repo root: run e2e tests (auto-starts dashboard on :3001)
npm run test:playwright

# UI mode
npm run test:playwright:ui
````

Requirements:

- A PostgreSQL instance and `.env` configured (DATABASE*URL or DB*\* vars)
- The dashboard will be launched by Playwright via `bun run dev:dashboard`

```
