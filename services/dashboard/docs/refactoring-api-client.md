# API Client Refactoring

## Date: 2025-01-20

## Summary

Refactored the `api-client.ts` file to improve code quality, maintainability, and type safety. Reduced file size from 655 lines to 305 lines (53% reduction) while maintaining all functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Extracted Common Request Logic

- Created a private `request<T>()` method that centralizes all HTTP request logic
- Eliminated 15+ duplicated try-catch blocks and error handling patterns
- Centralized URL construction and query parameter handling

### 2. Improved Type Safety

- Moved all interface definitions to a separate `api-client.types.ts` file
- Removed unnecessary type assertions (`as T`)
- Created proper type exports for better module organization

### 3. Enhanced Documentation

- Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to the ProxyApiClient class
- Documented all public methods with parameter descriptions and return types
- Added usage example in the class documentation

### 4. Simplified Method Implementations

- Each API method now delegates to the central `request()` method
- Reduced average method size from ~30 lines to ~3 lines
- Maintained backward compatibility for all public APIs

### 5. Removed Dead Code

- Removed deprecated `convertToDashboardFormat()` method (verified unused)
- Kept generic methods (get, post, fetch) as they are actively used by 7 files

## Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Changes to error handling or authentication now only need to be made in one place
- **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript integration with separated type definitions
- **Readability**: Cleaner, more concise method implementations
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new API endpoints following the established pattern
- **Developer Experience**: Better IDE support with comprehensive JSDoc comments

## Testing

- Type checking passes for the api-client module
- Dashboard server starts successfully with refactored client
- All existing functionality preserved

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding request retry logic in the central `request()` method
- Could add request/response interceptors for cross-cutting concerns
- Potential for adding caching layer for GET requests
