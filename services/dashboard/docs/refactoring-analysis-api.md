# Analysis API Routes Refactoring

## Date: 2025-01-20

## Overview

Refactored the `analysis-api.ts` file to improve code quality, maintainability, and consistency following Hono framework best practices.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Comprehensive JSDoc Documentation

- Added file-level documentation explaining the purpose of the routes
- Added detailed JSDoc comments for each endpoint including parameters, request body, and response codes

### 2. Extracted API Client Check to Middleware

- Created `middleware/api-client.ts` with `requireApiClient` middleware
- Removed duplicate API client null checks from each route handler
- Applied middleware to all routes with `analysisRoutes.use('*', requireApiClient)`

### 3. Improved Type Safety

- Removed use of `any` type in error handling
- Fixed HttpError constructor call to use correct parameter order
- Added proper TypeScript import for ProxyApiClient type

### 4. Added Parameter Validation Schema

- Created `AnalysisParamsSchema` for validating conversationId and branchId
- Replaced manual UUID validation with Zod schema validation
- Added proper error messages for validation failures

### 5. Implemented Request Body Support for Regenerate Endpoint

- Added `RegenerateAnalysisBodySchema` to shared package
- Implemented body parsing for customPrompt parameter
- Updated tests to verify customPrompt functionality

### 6. Standardized Error Handling

- Implemented centralized error handler with `analysisRoutes.onError()`
- Consistent error logging with full context (path, method, stack trace)
- Unified error response format across all endpoints
- Proper handling of Zod validation errors

### 7. Simplified Route Handlers

- Removed try-catch boilerplate by relying on centralized error handler
- Route handlers now only catch expected application-specific errors
- Cleaner code flow with guaranteed non-null apiClient

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: API client checks and error handling are centralized
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Consistent patterns across all routes
3. **Better Error Handling**: All errors are logged with full context
4. **Enhanced Type Safety**: No more `any` types, proper validation schemas
5. **Feature Complete**: Regenerate endpoint now supports customPrompt as intended
6. **Better Testing**: All tests pass with improved coverage

## Testing

- All 19 tests pass successfully
- Added new test for regenerate endpoint with customPrompt
- Type checking passes without errors

## Follow-up Considerations

- Consider using `@hono/zod-validator` middleware for even cleaner validation
- Could add request/response logging middleware for debugging
- Consider rate limiting middleware for production use
