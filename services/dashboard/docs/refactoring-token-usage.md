# Token Usage Route Refactoring

## Date: 2025-01-20

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring of `services/dashboard/src/routes/token-usage.ts` as part of the file grooming sprint to improve code quality and maintainability.

## Issues Identified

1. **Large inline JavaScript**: The file contained massive inline JavaScript for chart rendering (200+ lines each)
2. **Complex nested HTML templates**: Heavy use of nested template literals with raw() calls
3. **Mixed concerns**: Chart rendering logic was mixed with route handling and HTML generation
4. **Code duplication**: Similar chart rendering patterns were repeated
5. **Magic numbers**: Hard-coded values for colors, dimensions, and thresholds
6. **Poor separation of concerns**: Business logic, presentation, and charting were all mixed
7. **No error boundaries**: Chart rendering errors could break the entire page
8. **Accessibility issues**: Canvas charts without proper ARIA labels
9. **Performance**: Large inline scripts regenerated on every request

## Refactoring Approach

### 1. Created Utility Modules

- **`utils/token-usage-charts.ts`**: Chart-specific utilities including:
  - Token usage color constants and thresholds
  - Chart dimension configurations
  - Helper functions for generating chart scripts
  - Progress bar generation
  - Type definitions for chart data

- **`utils/token-usage-helpers.ts`**: HTML generation helpers including:
  - Token stats grid component
  - Daily usage table component
  - Rate limits table component
  - Section wrapper component
  - Error banner component
  - Back link component

### 2. Leveraged Existing Utilities

- Used existing `formatNumber` from `utils/chart-helpers.ts`
- Discovered and utilized existing chart constants and helpers

### 3. Improved Code Organization

- Extracted inline chart scripts to dedicated functions
- Created reusable components for common UI patterns
- Simplified HTML templates by using helper functions
- Added proper TypeScript types for chart data

### 4. Enhanced Maintainability

- Centralized color and threshold constants
- Made chart dimensions configurable
- Reduced code duplication
- Improved error handling consistency

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Chart generation logic can be optimized in one place
2. **Maintainability**: Changes to chart styling or behavior only need to be made in utility files
3. **Reusability**: Chart utilities can be used by other routes
4. **Testability**: Isolated functions are easier to unit test
5. **Readability**: Route file is now focused on data fetching and orchestration
6. **Type Safety**: Added proper TypeScript types for chart data structures

## Future Improvements

As suggested by Gemini during the consensus review:

1. **Consider a charting library**: Evaluate Chart.js or ApexCharts for better features and accessibility
2. **Static asset serving**: Move chart scripts to static JavaScript files for browser caching
3. **Progressive enhancement**: Add fallback content for when JavaScript is disabled
4. **ARIA labels**: Improve accessibility with proper ARIA attributes on charts

## Testing

- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Successful
- Build process: ✅ Successful
- No functional changes were made, only code organization improvements

## Conclusion

The refactoring successfully improved code quality while maintaining all existing functionality. The file is now more maintainable, follows better separation of concerns, and is ready for future enhancements.
