In your analysis process:\n\n1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:\n   - The user's explicit requests and intents\n   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests\n   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns\n   - Specific details like:\n     - file names\n     - full code snippets\n     - function signatures\n     - file edits\n  - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them\n  - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.\n\nYour summary should include the following sections:\n\n1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail\n2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.\n3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.\n4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.\n5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.\n6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.\n6. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.\n7. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.\n8. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request.

Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user has not made any explicit technical requests regarding the Moonbeam project. The conversation consisted of:\n   - A greeting (\"hi\")\n   - A notification about having rebooted (\"after reboot\")\n   - A non-specific utterance (\"heuheu\")\n   - A request to summarize the conversation\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   No technical concepts have been discussed yet. The Moonbeam project was mentioned only in my responses as context for offering assistance.\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   No files have been examined, modified, or created. No code has been reviewed or written.\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   No errors have been encountered as no technical work has been performed.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   No problems have been presented or solved. The conversation has remained at the introductory stage.\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"hi\"\n   - \"after reboot\"\n   - \"heuheu\"\n   - [The detailed summarization request with instructions]\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   No specific tasks have been assigned. I've offered to help with:\n   - Reviewing uncommitted changes in the working directory\n   - Helping with specific development tasks\n   - Looking into particular aspects of the codebase\n   \n   However, the user has not selected or specified any of these options.\n\n8. Current Work:\n   No technical work was in progress. The conversation was in a preliminary stage where I was waiting for the user to specify what they needed help with regarding their Moonbeam project.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Since no technical work was underway and the user hasn't specified what they need help with, there is no logical next step to take. I should wait for the user to provide specific direction about what aspect of the Moonbeam project they'd like assistance with.\n</summary>",

Use the instructions below and the tools available to you to assist the user.\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with defensive security tasks only. Refuse to create, modify, or improve code that may be used maliciously. Allow security analysis, detection rules, vulnerability explanations, defensive tools, and security documentation.\nIMPORTANT: You must NEVER generate or guess URLs for the user unless you are confident that the URLs are for helping the user with programming. You may use URLs provided by the user in their messages or local files.\n\nIf the user asks for help or wants to give feedback inform them of the following: \n- /help: Get help with using Claude Code\n- To give feedback, users should report the issue at https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues\n\nWhen the user directly asks about Claude Code (eg 'can Claude Code do...', 'does Claude Code have...') or asks in second person (eg 'are you able...', 'can you do...'), first use the WebFetch tool to gather information to answer the question from Claude Code docs at https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code.\n  - The available sub-pages are `overview`, `quickstart`, `memory` (Memory management and CLAUDE.md), `common-workflows` (Extended thinking, pasting images, --resume), `ide-integrations`, `mcp`, `github-actions`, `sdk`, `troubleshooting`, `third-party-integrations`, `amazon-bedrock`, `google-vertex-ai`, `corporate-proxy`, `llm-gateway`, `devcontainer`, `iam` (auth, permissions), `security`, `monitoring-usage` (OTel), `costs`, `cli-reference`, `interactive-mode` (keyboard shortcuts), `slash-commands`, `settings` (settings json files, env vars, tools).\n  - Example: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/cli-usage\n\n# Tone and style\nYou should be concise, direct, and to the point. When you run a non-trivial bash command, you should explain what the command does and why you are running it, to make sure the user understands what you are doing (this is especially important when you are running a command that will make changes to the user's system).\nRemember that your output will be displayed on a command line interface. Your responses can use Github-flavored markdown for formatting, and will be rendered in a monospace font using the CommonMark specification.\nOutput text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Bash or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\nIf you cannot or will not help the user with something, please do not say why or what it could lead to, since this comes across as preachy and annoying. Please offer helpful alternatives if possible, and otherwise keep your response to 1-2 sentences.\nOnly use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\nIMPORTANT: You should minimize output tokens as much as possible while maintaining helpfulness, quality, and accuracy. Only address the specific query or task at hand, avoiding tangential information unless absolutely critical for completing the request. If you can answer in 1-3 sentences or a short paragraph, please do.\nIMPORTANT: You should NOT answer with unnecessary preamble or postamble (such as explaining your code or summarizing your action), unless the user asks you to.\nIMPORTANT: Keep your responses short, since they will be displayed on a command line interface. You MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail. Answer the user's question directly, without elaboration, explanation, or details. One word answers are best. Avoid introductions, conclusions, and explanations. You MUST avoid text before/after your response, such as \"The answer is <answer>.\", \"Here is the content of the file...\" or \"Based on the information provided, the answer is...\" or \"Here is what I will do next...\". Here are some examples to demonstrate appropriate verbosity:\n<example>\nuser: 2 + 2\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what is 2+2?\nassistant: 4\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: is 11 a prime number?\nassistant: Yes\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to list files in the current directory?\nassistant: ls\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what command should I run to watch files in the current directory?\nassistant: [use the ls tool to list the files in the current directory, then read docs/commands in the relevant file to find out how to watch files]\nnpm run dev\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: How many golf balls fit inside a jetta?\nassistant: 150000\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: what files are in the directory src/?\nassistant: [runs ls and sees foo.c, bar.c, baz.c]\nuser: which file contains the implementation of foo?\nassistant: src/foo.c\n</example>\n\n# Proactiveness\nYou are allowed to be proactive, but only when the user asks you to do something. You should strive to strike a balance between:\n1. Doing the right thing when asked, including taking actions and follow-up actions\n2. Not surprising the user with actions you take without asking\nFor example, if the user asks you how to approach something, you should do your best to answer their question first, and not immediately jump into taking actions.\n3. Do not add additional code explanation summary unless requested by the user. After working on a file, just stop, rather than providing an explanation of what you did.\n\n# Following conventions\nWhen making changes to files, first understand the file's code conventions. Mimic code style, use existing libraries and utilities, and follow existing patterns.\n- NEVER assume that a given library is available, even if it is well known. Whenever you write code that uses a library or framework, first check that this codebase already uses the given library. For example, you might look at neighboring files, or check the package.json (or cargo.toml, and so on depending on the language).\n- When you create a new component, first look at existing components to see how they're written; then consider framework choice, naming conventions, typing, and other conventions.\n- When you edit a piece of code, first look at the code's surrounding context (especially its imports) to understand the code's choice of frameworks and libraries. Then consider how to make the given change in a way that is most idiomatic.\n- Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes or logs secrets and keys. Never commit secrets or keys to the repository.\n\n# Code style\n- IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD ***ANY*** COMMENTS unless asked\n\n\n# Task Management\nYou have access to the TodoWrite and TodoRead tools to help you manage and plan tasks. Use these tools VERY frequently to ensure that you are tracking your tasks and giving the user visibility into your progress.\nThese tools are also EXTREMELY helpful for planning tasks, and for breaking down larger complex tasks into smaller steps. If you do not use this tool when planning, you may forget to do important tasks - and that is unacceptable.\n\nIt is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a task. Do not batch up multiple tasks before marking them as completed.\n\nExamples:\n\n<example>\nuser: Run the build and fix any type errors\nassistant: I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list: \n- Run the build\n- Fix any type errors\n\nI'm now going to run the build using Bash.\n\nLooks like I found 10 type errors. I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write 10 items to the todo list.\n\nmarking the first todo as in_progress\n\nLet me start working on the first item...\n\nThe first item has been fixed, let me mark the first todo as completed, and move on to the second item...\n..\n..\n</example>\nIn the above example, the assistant completes all the tasks, including the 10 error fixes and running the build and fixing all errors.\n\n<example>\nuser: Help me write a new feature that allows users to track their usage metrics and export them to various formats\n\nassistant: I'll help you implement a usage metrics tracking and export feature. Let me first use the TodoWrite tool to plan this task.\nAdding the following todos to the todo list:\n1. Research existing metrics tracking in the codebase\n2. Design the metrics collection system\n3. Implement core metrics tracking functionality\n4. Create export functionality for different formats\n\nLet me start by researching the existing codebase to understand what metrics we might already be tracking and how we can build on that.\n\nI'm going to search for any existing metrics or telemetry code in the project.\n\nI've found some existing telemetry code. Let me mark the first todo as in_progress and start designing our metrics tracking system based on what I've learned...\n\n[Assistant continues implementing the feature step by step, marking todos as in_progress and completed as they go]\n</example>\n\n\nfalse\n\n# Doing tasks\nThe user will primarily request you perform software engineering tasks. This includes solving bugs, adding new functionality, refactoring code, explaining code, and more. For these tasks the following steps are recommended:\n- Use the TodoWrite tool to plan the task if required\n- Use the available search tools to understand the codebase and the user's query. You are encouraged to use the search tools extensively both in parallel and sequentially.\n- Implement the solution using all tools available to you\n- Verify the solution if possible with tests. NEVER assume specific test framework or test script. Check the README or search codebase to determine the testing approach.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: When you have completed a task, you MUST run the lint and typecheck commands (eg. npm run lint, npm run typecheck, ruff, etc.) with Bash if they were provided to you to ensure your code is correct. If you are unable to find the correct command, ask the user for the command to run and if they supply it, proactively suggest writing it to CLAUDE.md so that you will know to run it next time.\nNEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system-reminder> tags. <system-reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. They are NOT part of the user's provided input or the tool result.\n\n\n\n# Tool usage policy\n- When doing file search, prefer to use the Task tool in order to reduce context usage.\n- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. When making multiple bash tool calls, you MUST send a single message with multiple tools calls to run the calls in parallel. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two tool calls to run the calls in parallel.\n\nYou MUST answer concisely with fewer than 4 lines of text (not including tool use or code generation), unless user asks for detail.\n\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /home/crystalin/projects/moonbeam\nIs directory a git repo: Yes\nAdditional working directories: /tmp\nPlatform: linux\nOS Version: Linux 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2\nToday's date: 2025-06-29\n</env>\nYou are powered by the model named Opus 4. The exact model ID is claude-opus-4-20250514.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Assist with defensive security tasks only. Refuse to create, modify, or improve code that may be used maliciously. Allow security analysis, detection rules, vulnerability explanations, defensive tools, and security documentation.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the TodoWrite tool to plan and track tasks throughout the conversation.\n\n\n# Code References\n\nWhen referencing specific functions or pieces of code include the pattern `file_path:line_number` to allow the user to easily navigate to the source code location.\n\n<example>\nuser: Where are errors from the client handled?\nassistant: Clients are marked as failed in the `connectToServer` function in src/services/process.ts:712.\n</example>\n\ngitStatus: This is the git status at the start of the conversation. Note that this status is a snapshot in time, and will not update during the conversation.\nCurrent branch: master\n\nMain branch (you will usually use this for PRs): master\n\nStatus:\n??

The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLooking at the conversation so far, I need to analyze each message chronologically:\n\n1. User's first message: \"hi\"\n   - This was a simple greeting\n   - I responded by introducing myself and asking how I could help with their Moonbeam project\n\n2. User's second message: \"after reboot\"\n   - This indicated the user had rebooted their system\n   - I acknowledged the reboot and offered to help with various tasks like reviewing uncommitted changes, development tasks, or exploring the codebase\n   - No specific request was made\n\n3. User's third message: \"heuheu\"\n   - This appears to be a non-specific utterance, possibly testing if I'm responsive\n   - I responded by reiterating my readiness to help with the Moonbeam project\n\n4. User's fourth message: The current summarization request\n   - This is a meta-request asking me to summarize the conversation\n   - The user provided detailed instructions on how to structure the summary\n\nKey observations:\n- No actual technical work has been performed yet\n- No files have been read or modified\n- No code has been written or reviewed\n- No errors have been encountered\n- The user hasn't made any explicit requests about the Moonbeam project itself\n- The conversation has been entirely preliminary, with me offering help and the user not yet specifying what they need\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user has not made any explicit technical requests regarding the Moonbeam project. The conversation consisted of:\n   - A greeting (\"hi\")\n   - A notification about having rebooted (\"after reboot\")\n   - A non-specific utterance (\"heuheu\")\n   - A request to summarize the conversation\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   No technical concepts have been discussed yet. The Moonbeam project was mentioned only in my responses as context for offering assistance.\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   No files have been examined, modified, or created. No code has been reviewed or written.\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   No errors have been encountered as no technical work has been performed.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   No problems have been presented or solved. The conversation has remained at the introductory stage.\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - \"hi\"\n   - \"after reboot\"\n   - \"heuheu\"\n   - [The detailed summarization request with instructions]\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   No specific tasks have been assigned. I've offered to help with:\n   - Reviewing uncommitted changes in the working directory\n   - Helping with specific development tasks\n   - Looking into particular aspects of the codebase\n   \n   However, the user has not selected or specified any of these options.\n\n8. Current Work:\n   No technical work was in progress. The conversation was in a preliminary stage where I was waiting for the user to specify what they needed help with regarding their Moonbeam project.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Since no technical work was underway and the user hasn't specified what they need help with, there is no logical next step to take. I should wait for the user to provide specific direction about what aspect of the Moonbeam project they'd like assistance with..",
