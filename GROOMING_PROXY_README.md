## Rationale

The proxy README was significantly outdated compared to the actual implementation. This update brings it in line with:

1. The current feature set documented in CLAUDE.md
2. The architectural patterns actually implemented
3. The comprehensive API surface exposed by the proxy
4. Modern documentation standards for service-specific READMEs

The focus was on making the documentation comprehensive for proxy-specific details while avoiding duplication of general project information already in CLAUDE.md and the main README.

## Notes

- TypeScript compilation errors found are pre-existing and unrelated to documentation changes
- The README now serves as a complete reference for developers working specifically with the proxy service
- All environment variables are now documented with clear categorization
